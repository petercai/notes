# how to use auth0 in web app
To use Auth0 authentication in your web application:

1.  Sign up for an Auth0 account and create a new application.
2.  Add the necessary dependencies to your project, such as the Auth0 JavaScript SDK.
3.  Configure the SDK with your Auth0 account details, including the domain and client ID.
4.  Implement the login process in your application, including redirecting the user to the Auth0 login page.
5.  After the user logs in, handle the authentication response and store the user's information in your application.
6.  Use the stored information to secure your application and determine what resources the user is authorized to access.
7.  Implement logout functionality to allow the user to log out of your application.

For detailed steps and code examples, you can refer to the Auth0 documentation: [https://auth0.com/docs/](https://auth0.com/docs/).
