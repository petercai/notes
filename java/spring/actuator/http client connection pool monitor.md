To monitor the **HttpClient connection pool** in a **Spring Boot 3.4.5** application, especially since Spring Framework 6+ (used in Spring Boot 3.x) now supports **Apache HttpClient 5** by default, here‚Äôs how you can proceed:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Use Apache HttpClient 5 with Pooling**

Spring Boot 3.x uses HttpClient 5, so you should configure it accordingly:

```java
@Bean
public CloseableHttpClient httpClient() {
    PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager connectionManager = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();
    connectionManager.setMaxTotal(100);
    connectionManager.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(20);

    return HttpClients.custom()
            .setConnectionManager(connectionManager)
            .evictIdleConnections(TimeValue.ofMinutes(1))
            .build();
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Expose Connection Pool Metrics**

Apache HttpClient 5 provides access to connection pool stats via the `PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager`:

```java
@Autowired
private PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager connectionManager;

@Scheduled(fixedRate = 10000)
public void logConnectionPoolStats() {
    PoolStats totalStats = connectionManager.getTotalStats();
    System.out.println("Max: " + totalStats.getMax() +
                       ", Available: " + totalStats.getAvailable() +
                       ", Leased: " + totalStats.getLeased() +
                       ", Pending: " + totalStats.getPending());
}
```

You can also expose this via an actuator endpoint or Prometheus metrics if you're using Micrometer.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Integrate with Spring Boot Actuator**

If you're using **Spring Boot Actuator**, you can create a custom `MeterBinder` to expose these stats:

```java
@Bean
public MeterBinder connectionPoolMetrics(PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager connectionManager) {
    return registry -> {
        registry.gauge("httpclient.connections.available", connectionManager, 
            cm -> cm.getTotalStats().getAvailable());
        registry.gauge("httpclient.connections.leased", connectionManager, 
            cm -> cm.getTotalStats().getLeased());
        registry.gauge("httpclient.connections.pending", connectionManager, 
            cm -> cm.getTotalStats().getPending());
    };
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Use Micrometer for Monitoring**

Make sure you have Micrometer and the appropriate registry (e.g., Prometheus) on your classpath:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
    <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

# 2. monitoring 

**Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It‚Äôs widely used to collect and store metrics as time series data, which means it records information with a timestamp, labels, and values.

---

### üîç What is Prometheus?

- **Purpose**: Collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals.
- **Data Model**: Stores time-series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs (labels).
- **Query Language**: Uses **PromQL** to query and analyze metrics.
- **Visualization**: Often paired with **Grafana** for dashboards.

---

### üì¶ What is the Prometheus Registry in Micrometer?

In the context of **Spring Boot and Micrometer**, a **Prometheus registry** is a component that:

- Collects metrics from your application (like HTTP request counts, memory usage, or custom metrics).
- Exposes them in a format that Prometheus can scrape (usually at `/actuator/prometheus`).

---

### üß© How It Works Together

1. **Micrometer** collects metrics in your Spring Boot app.
2. **Prometheus registry** formats those metrics.
3. **Prometheus server** scrapes the `/actuator/prometheus` endpoint.
4. **Grafana** (optional) visualizes the data.
