# how to use oidc nonce
A nonce (short for "number used once") is a value in OpenID Connect (OIDC) that is used to protect against replay attacks. It helps ensure that an authorization code returned from the authorization server is used only once and for the intended user.

Here's how you can use and verify a nonce in your OIDC authentication flow:

1.  When redirecting the user to the authorization server's authorization endpoint, include a `nonce` parameter in the URL, with a unique value generated by your application.

Example URL with `nonce` parameter:

perlCopy code

`https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/authorize?
    response_type=code
    &client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    &redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
    &scope=openid profile
    &state=YOUR_STATE
    &nonce=UNIQUE_NONCE_VALUE` 

2.  After the user logs in and grants permission, the authorization server will redirect the user back to the `redirect_uri` specified in the initial request, along with the authorization code, `state`, and `nonce`.
    
3.  In your application, verify the `nonce` value returned from the authorization server by comparing it to the `nonce` value you generated in step 1. If the values match, it means that the authorization code was intended for your application and can be used to obtain an ID token. If the values do not match, it could indicate an attempt to reuse an authorization code and you should reject the request.
    

Note: When generating and storing a `nonce` value, be sure to use a unique and random value to prevent attackers from guessing or predicting the value. Also, ensure that the `nonce` value is stored securely, as it may contain sensitive information about the user.
