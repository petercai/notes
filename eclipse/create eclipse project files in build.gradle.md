To generate Eclipse project files using `build.gradle`, you can apply the **Eclipse plugin** provided by Gradle. Here's how to do it:

### âœ… Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Apply the Eclipse plugin** in your `build.gradle` file:
    
    ```Groovy
    plugins {
        id 'java'
        id 'eclipse'
    }
    ```
    
2. **Generate Eclipse project files** by running the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```Shell
    gradle eclipse
    ```
    
    This will generate:
    
    - `.project` and `.classpath` files for Eclipse
    - `.settings/` folder with project-specific settings
3. **Optional Customization**: You can customize the Eclipse project generation using the `eclipse` DSL:
    
    ```Groovy
    eclipse {
        project {
            name = 'MyCustomProjectName'
        }
        classpath {
            downloadSources = true
            downloadJavadoc = true
        }
    }
    ```
    
4. **Import into Eclipse**:
    
    - Open Eclipse
    - Go to `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`
    - Select the root directory of your Gradle project
    - Eclipse will detect the `.project` file and import it
