# chage macos end key behavior to end of line

To change the behavior of the **End** key on macOS to move to the end of the line instead of the end of the document, you can remap the key bindings. Here's how you can do it:

## Remapping Home and End Keys

1. **Create a KeyBindings File**:
    - Open the Terminal app on your Mac.
    - Run the following command to create a directory and file if they don't exist:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/Library/KeyBindings
```

    - Then, create a file named `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` in that directory with the following content:

```json
{
  /* Remap Home / End keys to be correct */
  "\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:"; /* Home */
  "\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLine:"; /* End */
  "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Home */
  "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + End */
  "^\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:"; /* Ctrl + Home */
  "^\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfDocument:"; /* Ctrl + End */
  "$^\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfDocumentAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Ctrl + Home */
  "$^\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfDocumentAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Ctrl + End */
}
```

    - You can use the following command to create the file directly:

```bash
echo '{
  /* Remap Home / End keys to be correct */
  "\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLine:"; /* Home */
  "\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLine:"; /* End */
  "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Home */
  "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + End */
  "^\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfDocument:"; /* Ctrl + Home */
  "^\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfDocument:"; /* Ctrl + End */
  "$^\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfDocumentAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Ctrl + Home */
  "$^\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfDocumentAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Ctrl + End */
}' &gt; $HOME/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
```

2. **Restart Applications**:
    - After creating or modifying the `DefaultKeyBinding.dict` file, you need to restart any applications where you want these changes to take effect.

Alternatively, you can use **Command + Right Arrow** to move to the end of the line in most macOS applications, which is a built-in shortcut that doesn't require remapping[^3][^4].

## Alternative Method Using Karabiner

If you prefer a more comprehensive solution that can handle multiple keyboard remappings, you might consider using **Karabiner** (previously known as KeyRemap4MacBook). This tool allows you to remap keys across all applications on your Mac[^4].
