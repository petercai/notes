# check if a collection exists in MongoDB

1. **Using `list_collection_names()`**:
   - The `list_collection_names()` method returns a list of all collection names within a database.
   - You can use this to check if a specific collection exists.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pymongo

     # Connect to MongoDB
     connection = pymongo.MongoClient('localhost', 27017)
     db = connection['my_database']

     # Get a list of collections in 'my_database'
     list_of_collections = db.list_collection_names()

     # Check if collection "my_collection" exists
     if "my_collection" in list_of_collections:
         print("Collection 'my_collection' exists!")
     else:
         print("Collection 'my_collection' does not exist.")
     ```
     This approach is straightforward and efficient.

2. **Using `validate_collection()`**:
   - The `validate_collection()` method validates a collection. If the collection doesn't exist, it raises a `pymongo.errors.OperationFailure` exception.
   - You can catch this exception to handle the case where the collection doesn't exist.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pymongo

     # Connect to MongoDB
     connection = pymongo.MongoClient('localhost', 27017)
     db = connection['my_database']

     try:
         db.validate_collection("my_collection")
         print("Collection 'my_collection' exists!")
     except pymongo.errors.OperationFailure:
         print("Collection 'my_collection' does not exist.")
     ```
     This method also allows you to handle the exception gracefully.

Choose the method that best suits your needs based on your specific use case. Happy MongoDB querying! üåüüêç

# MongoDB insert/upate records to collection

```python
import pymongo

def insert_or_update_records(database_name, collection_name, records):
    # Connect to MongoDB
    client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
    db = client[database_name]
    collection = db[collection_name]

    # Check if the collection exists
    if collection.count_documents({}):
        # Update existing records or insert new ones
        for record in records:
            existing_record = collection.find_one({'_id': record['_id']})
            if existing_record:
                # Update existing record
                collection.update_one({'_id': record['_id']}, {'$set': record})
            else:
                # Insert new record
                collection.insert_one(record)
    else:
        # Create the collection and insert records
        collection.insert_many(records)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_database_name = "mydb"
    my_collection_name = "mycollection"
    my_records = [
        {"_id": 1, "name": "Alice", "age": 30},
        {"_id": 2, "name": "Bob", "age": 25},
        # Add more records as needed
    ]

    insert_or_update_records(my_database_name, my_collection_name, my_records)
```

In this code:
- Replace `"mongodb://localhost:27017/"` with your actual MongoDB connection string.
- Modify the `my_records` list to include the records you want to insert or update.
- The `_id` field is used as a unique identifier for each record. If you have a different unique field, adjust accordingly.

This code will create the collection if it doesn't exist, insert new records, and update existing records based on the `_id` field. üåüüêç

# In MongoDB, you can set a record to automatically expire using the **Time to Live (TTL)** feature. 

This allows you to store data in MongoDB and have the database automatically remove documents after a specified period of time or at a specific clock time.

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **TTL Index Creation**:
   - To enable automatic expiration, create a **TTL index** on a field that holds values of BSON date type or an array of BSON date-typed objects.
   - Specify the `expireAfterSeconds` option to set the time duration after which documents should expire.
   - Example using the MongoDB shell:
     ```javascript
     // Create a TTL index on the "expiresAfter" field
     db.my_collection.createIndex({ "expiresAfter": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 }); // Expires after 1 hour (3600 seconds)
     ```
   - In this example, any document with a value in the "expiresAfter" field older than 1 hour will be automatically removed.

2. **Setting Expiration Time**:
   - For each document in the collection, set the indexed date field to a value corresponding to the time when the document should expire.
   - MongoDB's background thread will periodically check the TTL index and remove expired documents.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Data expiration is useful for scenarios such as machine-generated event data, logs, and session information that only need to persist for a limited period.
   - You can apply TTL collections in MongoDB Atlas (managed service), MongoDB Enterprise (self-managed), and MongoDB Community (free-to-use).

Remember that the TTL index is a powerful tool for managing data expiration, but it's essential to design your schema carefully to ensure that it aligns with your application's requirements. üåüüçÉ

For more detailed information, refer to the [official MongoDB documentation on expiring data](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/expire-data/).¬π

(3) Expire Data from Collections by Setting TTL ‚Äî MongoDB Manual. https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v7.0/tutorial/expire-data/.

## Let me clarify the purpose of those two values:

1. `{ "expiresAfter": 1 }`:
   - This part specifies the field in your documents that will be used to determine when a document should expire.
   - In this example, the field named `"expiresAfter"` holds a date or timestamp value.
   - MongoDB will check this field to determine if a document has expired.

2. `{ expireAfterSeconds: 3600 }`:
   - This part sets the duration after which a document should expire (in seconds).
   - In this case, the value `3600` corresponds to 1 hour.
   - If a document's `"expiresAfter"` field is older than 1 hour, MongoDB will automatically remove it from the collection.

So, combining these two parts, you're creating a **TTL index** on the `"expiresAfter"` field, and any document with a timestamp older than 1 hour will be automatically deleted.


Save From : [Expire Data from Collections by Setting TTL ‚Äî MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/expire-data/#expire-documents-after-a-specified-number-of-seconds) 


## Expire Documents after a Specified Number of Seconds


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can expire data after a specified number of seconds in the terminal. To expire data after a specified number of seconds has passed since the indexed field, create a TTL index on a field that holds values of BSON date type or an array of BSON date-typed objects _and_ specify a positive non-zero value in the `expireAfterSeconds` field. A document will expire when the number of seconds in the `expireAfterSeconds` field has passed since the time specified in its indexed field. [\[1\]](#footnote-field-is-array-of-dates)

The TTL index `expireAfterSeconds` value must be within `0` and `2147483647` inclusive.

For example, the following operation creates an index on the `log_events` collection's `createdAt` field and specifies the `expireAfterSeconds` value of `10` to set the expiration time to be ten seconds after the time specified by `createdAt`.

```null
db.log_events.createIndex( { "createdAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 10 } )
```

When adding documents to the `log_events` collection, set the `createdAt` field to the current time:

```null
db.log_events.insertOne( {   "createdAt": new Date(),   "logEvent": 2,   "logMessage": "Success!"} )
```

MongoDB will automatically delete documents from the `log_events` collection when the document's `createdAt` value [\[1\]](#footnote-field-is-array-of-dates) is older than the number of seconds specified in `expireAfterSeconds`.


## Expire Documents at a Specific Clock Time

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can expire data at a specified clock time in the terminal. To expire documents at a specific clock time, begin by creating a TTL index on a field that holds values of BSON date type or an array of BSON date-typed objects _and_ specify an `expireAfterSeconds` value of `0`. For each document in the collection, set the indexed date field to a value corresponding to the time the document should expire. If the indexed date field contains a date in the past, MongoDB considers the document expired.

For example, the following operation creates an index on the `log_events` collection's `expireAt` field and specifies the `expireAfterSeconds` value of `0`:

```null
db.log_events.createIndex( { "expireAt": 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 0 } )
```

For each document, set the value of `expireAt` to correspond to the time the document should expire. For example, the following [`insertOne()`](/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne/#mongodb-method-db.collection.insertOne) operation adds a document that expires at `July 22, 2013 14:00:00`.

```null
db.log_events.insertOne( {   "expireAt": new Date('July 22, 2013 14:00:00'),   "logEvent": 2,   "logMessage": "Success!"} )
```

MongoDB will automatically delete documents from the `log_events` collection when the documents' `expireAt` value is older than the number of seconds specified in `expireAfterSeconds`, i.e. `0` seconds older in this case. As such, the data expires at the specified `expireAt` value.


To create a time series collection in MongoDB using **PyMongo** and set documents to expire at a specific clock time, follow these steps:

1. **Create a TTL Index**:
   - First, create a TTL (Time to Live) index on a field that holds values of BSON date type or an array of BSON date-typed objects.
   - Set the `expireAfterSeconds` option to `0` (zero) to indicate that documents should expire at a specific clock time.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pymongo
     from datetime import datetime

     # Connect to MongoDB
     client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
     db = client['my_database']

     # Create a TTL index on the "expireAt" field
     db.my_collection.create_index([("expireAt", pymongo.ASCENDING)], expireAfterSeconds=0)

     # Insert a document with a specific expiration time
     expiration_time = datetime(2024, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59)  # Set your desired expiration time
     db.my_collection.insert_one({
         "expireAt": expiration_time,
         "data": "Some data here"
     })
     ```

2. **Set the Expiration Time**:
   - For each document you insert into the collection, set the `"expireAt"` field to the specific clock time when the document should expire.
   - MongoDB will automatically remove documents once their `"expireAt"` time is reached.

Remember to replace `"my_database"` and `"my_collection"` with your actual database and collection names. Adjust the expiration time (`expiration_time`) according to your requirements. üåüüêç

## Create a collection in MongoDB using **PyMongo** and ensure it is created only if it doesn't exist

```python
import pymongo

def create_or_get_collection(database_name, collection_name):
    # Connect to MongoDB
    client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')

    # Get a reference to the specified database
    db = client[database_name]

    # Check if the collection exists
    if collection_name not in db.list_collection_names():
        # Create the collection
        db.create_collection(collection_name)

    # Get a reference to the collection (whether newly created or existing)
    collection = db[collection_name]
    return collection

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_database_name = "mydb"
    my_collection_name = "mycollection"

    my_collection = create_or_get_collection(my_database_name, my_collection_name)
    print(f"Collection '{my_collection_name}' is ready for use!")
```

In this improved code:
- The `create_or_get_collection` function checks if the collection exists in the specified database.
- If the collection doesn't exist, it creates it using `db.create_collection(collection_name)`.
- If the collection already exists, it simply returns a reference to the existing collection.
- Replace `"mydb"` and `"mycollection"` with your actual database and collection names.

This way, you can ensure that the collection is created only if it doesn't already exist. üåüüêç

# In **PyMongo**, you can use the `find_one()` method to search for a document based on a specific field

1. **Using `find_one()`**:
   - The `find_one()` method returns the first document that matches the specified query.
   - You can pass a dictionary (query) to the method to filter documents based on a specific field.
   - Example:
     ```python
     import pymongo

     # Connect to MongoDB
     client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
     db = client['mydb']  # Replace with your database name
     collection = db['mycollection']  # Replace with your collection name

     # Search for a document where the "field_name" equals a specific value
     query = {"field_name": "desired_value"}
     result = collection.find_one(query)

     if result:
         print("Found a matching document:")
         print(result)
     else:
         print("No matching document found.")
     ```

2. **Replace**:
   - Replace `"mydb"` with your actual database name.
   - Replace `"mycollection"` with your collection name.
   - Modify the `query` dictionary to match the field and value you're interested in.

Remember that `find_one()` returns the first matching document or `None` if no match is found. Adjust the query to suit your specific use case! üåüüêç

# MongoDB doesn't support **foreign key** (similar to SQL)  

However, you can achieve similar functionality by modeling your data appropriately. Let's explore how you can handle relationships between collections in MongoDB:

1. **Manual References**:
   - Instead of using foreign keys, MongoDB relies on **manual references**. You can store references to documents from one collection within another collection.
   - For example, consider a scenario where you have a `student` collection and a `course` collection. Each student is associated with specific courses. You can model it like this:

     ```json
     // Student document
     {
       "_id": ObjectId(...),
       "name": "Jane",
       "courses": [
         { "course": "bio101", "mark": 85 },
         { "course": "chem101", "mark": 89 }
       ]
     }

     // Course document
     {
       "_id": "bio101",
       "name": "Biology 101",
       "description": "Introduction to biology"
     }
     ```

   - In this example, Jane's `courses` field contains references to specific courses (using their `_id` values).
   - MongoDB does not enforce any constraints like foreign key constraints, but it does store the correct information.

2. **DBRef (Database References)**:
   - MongoDB has a **DBRef standard** that helps standardize the creation of references.
   - While not commonly used, DBRefs allow you to create references between documents in different collections.
   - However, it's essential to note that DBRefs are not enforced by the database itself; you must maintain data integrity manually.

3. **ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers)**:
   - If you prefer a more structured approach, consider using **ORMs** like **Mongoid** or **MongoMapper**.
   - These libraries provide higher-level abstractions for handling relationships and references in MongoDB.

Remember that MongoDB is not relational, and there is no standard "normal form." Design your database based on the data you store and the queries you intend to run¬π¬≤. While it lacks built-in foreign keys, MongoDB's flexibility allows you to model relationships effectively within your data.

Feel free to explore manual references or consider using an ORM if you need more complex relationships! üçÉüåê

# When using manual references in MongoDB, you can use the **aggregation framework** to join records. 

Let's explore how to join data from two collections using a single query:

Suppose we have the following collections: `students` and `courses`. Each student document contains an array of course references (manual references), like this:

```json
// Student document
{
  "_id": ObjectId("5f8a1e2c9c3a4e001f7e6b1a"),
  "name": "Jane",
  "courses": [
    { "course": ObjectId("5f8a1e2c9c3a4e001f7e6b1b"), "mark": 85 },
    { "course": ObjectId("5f8a1e2c9c3a4e001f7e6b1c"), "mark": 89 }
  ]
}

// Course document
{
  "_id": ObjectId("5f8a1e2c9c3a4e001f7e6b1b"),
  "name": "Biology 101",
  "description": "Introduction to biology"
}
```

To retrieve student information along with the corresponding course details, you can use the aggregation pipeline:

1. **Match Students**:
   - Filter students based on specific criteria (if needed).

2. **Unwind Courses**:
   - Unwind the `courses` array to create separate documents for each course reference.

3. **Lookup Courses**:
   - Use the `$lookup` stage to fetch course details from the `courses` collection based on the `course` field.
   - This stage performs a left outer join.

4. **Project Fields**:
   - Use the `$project` stage to shape the output document.
   - Include relevant fields from both the student and course documents.

Here's an example aggregation query:

```javascript
db.students.aggregate([
  {
    $unwind: "$courses"
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "courses",
      localField: "courses.course",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "courseDetails"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 1,
      name: 1,
      "courseDetails.name": 1,
      "courseDetails.description": 1,
      "courses.mark": 1
    }
  }
])
```

In the result, each student document will have an array of `courseDetails` containing the relevant course information.

Remember to adjust the field names (`students`, `courses`, `course`, etc.) to match your actual collection and document structure.

Keep in mind that manual references require you to manage data consistency and integrity manually. If you need more complex relationships or automatic enforcement, consider using an ORM or a different database system. üçÉüîó


# In MongoDB, you can't directly join records across different databases, but can combine data from different databases 
However, I'll guide you on how to achieve a similar effect by **combining data from different databases**.

1. **Manual References**:
   - Use **manual references** to link documents between databases.
   - Suppose you have two databases: `db1` and `db2`.
   - In `db1`, you have a collection called `students`, and in `db2`, you have a collection called `courses`.
   - Each student document in `students` contains an array of course references (similar to foreign keys).
   - Example:

     ```json
     // Student document in db1
     {
       "_id": ObjectId("..."),
       "name": "Jane",
       "courses": [
         { "course": ObjectId("..."), "mark": 85 },
         // Other course references...
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Aggregation Framework**:
   - Use the **aggregation pipeline** to combine data from different collections.
   - Here's an example query to retrieve student information along with their corresponding course details:

     ```javascript
     db.students.aggregate([
       { $unwind: "$courses" },
       {
         $lookup: {
           from: "courses",
           localField: "courses.course",
           foreignField: "_id",
           as: "courseDetails"
         }
       },
       {
         $project: {
           _id: 1,
           name: 1,
           "courseDetails.name": 1,
           "courseDetails.description": 1,
           "courses.mark": 1
         }
       }
     ])
     ```

   - This query unwinds the `courses` array, looks up course details from the `courses` collection, and projects relevant fields.

3. **Adjust Names**:
   - Replace `[database_1]`, `[table_schema]`, `[table_name_1]`, `[database_2]`, `[table_name_2]`, and field names with your actual database and collection names.

4. **Data Consistency**:
   - Remember that manual references require you to manage data consistency manually.
   - If you need more complex relationships or automatic enforcement, consider using an ORM or a different database system.

In summary, while MongoDB doesn't have native joins, you can achieve similar results using manual references and the aggregation framework. üçÉüîó

# create a **composite index** on multiple fields

1. **Import the Necessary Modules**:
    First, make sure you have the `pymongo` library installed. If not, you can install it using `pip install pymongo`. Then, import the required modules in your Python script:

    ```python
    from pymongo import MongoClient, IndexModel, ASCENDING, DESCENDING
    ```

2. **Create an Index Model**:
    Define an index model that specifies the fields and their sorting order. For example, to create a composite index on fields `"field_name1"` (descending) and `"field_name2"` (ascending), use the following code:

    ```python
    index_model = IndexModel([("field_name1", DESCENDING), ("field_name2", ASCENDING)], name="my_composite_index")
    ```

    Replace `"field_name1"` and `"field_name2"` with the actual field names from your collection.

3. **Create the Index**:
    Connect to your MongoDB database and collection, and then create the index using the `create_index` method:

    ```python
    client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")  # Replace with your MongoDB connection string
    db = client["my_database"]  # Replace with your database name
    collection = db["my_collection"]  # Replace with your collection name

    collection.create_index(index_model)
    ```

    Make sure to adjust the connection string, database name, and collection name according to your setup.

4. **Verify the Index**:
    You can verify that the index was created by checking your MongoDB shell or using the `list_indexes` method in PyMongo:

    ```python
    for index in collection.list_indexes():
        print(index)
    ```

    This will display information about all indexes in the collection, including your newly created composite index.

Remember to replace placeholders like `"mongodb://localhost:27017"`, `"my_database"`, and `"my_collection"` with your actual values. The `create_index` method will ensure that the composite index is applied to both specified fields¬π¬≤.

Happy indexing! üåüüîç

# perform aggregation operations using the `aggregate()` method. 

Aggregation allows you to group and manipulate data from multiple documents in MongoDB. Let's explore how to use the aggregation framework:

1. **Aggregation Framework Example**:
   Suppose we have a collection called `things` with documents containing a field called `tags`. We want to count the occurrences of each tag across the entire collection. Here's how you can achieve this using the aggregation framework:

   ```python
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   from bson.son import SON

   # Connect to the MongoDB database
   db = MongoClient().aggregation_example

   # Insert some example data
   result = db.things.insert_many([
       {"x": 1, "tags": ["dog", "cat"]},
       {"x": 2, "tags": ["cat"]},
       {"x": 2, "tags": ["mouse", "cat", "dog"]},
       {"x": 3, "tags": []}
   ])

   # Define the aggregation pipeline
   pipeline = [
       {"$unwind": "$tags"},
       {"$group": {"_id": "$tags", "count": {"$sum": 1}}},
       {"$sort": SON([("count", -1), ("_id", -1)])}
   ]

   # Execute the aggregation
   result = list(db.things.aggregate(pipeline))
   pprint.pprint(result)
   ```

   This will output the count of occurrences for each tag:

   ```
   [{'_id': 'cat', 'count': 3},
    {'_id': 'dog', 'count': 2},
    {'_id': 'mouse', 'count': 1}]
   ```

2. **Aggregation Pipelines**:
   Aggregation pipelines consist of a sequence of stages that transform and manipulate data. Each stage is a BSON document. You can use the `aggregate()` method to execute these pipelines. For example:

   ```python
   # Execute an aggregation pipeline
   pipeline = [
       {"$match": {"field": "value"}},
       {"$group": {"_id": "$category", "total": {"$sum": "$amount"}}}
   ]
   result = list(db.collection.aggregate(pipeline))
   ```

   In the above example, replace `"field"` and `"value"` with your specific criteria.

Remember that the aggregation framework provides powerful capabilities for data transformation and analysis in MongoDB. Feel free to explore more complex scenarios based on your requirements! üåü
