### Example Usage of Pi4J

Here's a simple example of using Pi4J to control an LED connected to a GPIO pin:

```java
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioController;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioFactory;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.GpioPinDigitalOutput;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.PinState;
import com.pi4j.io.gpio.RaspiPin;

public class BlinkingLED {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Create GPIO controller instance
        final GpioController gpio = GpioFactory.getInstance();

        // Provision GPIO pin #01 as an output pin and turn it on
        final GpioPinDigitalOutput pin = gpio.provisionDigitalOutputPin(RaspiPin.GPIO_01, "MyLED", PinState.HIGH);

        // Blink the LED 10 times
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            pin.toggle();
            Thread.sleep(500);
        }

        // Turn off the LED and release the GPIO controller
        pin.low();
        gpio.shutdown();
    }
}
```

This code initializes the GPIO controller, configures a pin as an output, and toggles the state of the pin to make an LED blink.

### Conclusion

For robust and versatile GPIO control in Java on a Raspberry Pi, **Pi4J** (either version 1 or the newer V2) is highly recommended. It provides extensive functionality, good documentation, and ease of integration, making it suitable for a wide range of projects.
