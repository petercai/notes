To configure PowerShell to read an alias file automatically when it starts, you need to customize the PowerShell profile. The profile is a script that PowerShell runs when it starts, allowing you to customize various settings and load additional modules or scripts.

Follow these steps to set up PowerShell to read an alias file at startup:

1.  **Open PowerShell:** Launch PowerShell by pressing `Win + X` on your keyboard and selecting "Windows PowerShell" from the menu (in Windows 10/11). Alternatively, you can search for "PowerShell" in the Start Menu and open it from there.
    
2.  **Check if a Profile Exists:** In PowerShell, type the following command and press `Enter`:
    
    
    `Test-Path $Profile` 
    
    This will check if a profile file exists for your PowerShell. If the command returns `False`, it means the profile doesn't exist, and you'll need to create one.
    
3.  **Create the Profile (If It Doesn't Exist):** If the previous command returned `False`, you can create a new profile by running the following command:

    
    `New-Item -Path $Profile -ItemType File -Force` 
    
    This command will create a new profile file if it doesn't exist.
    
4.  **Edit the Profile:** Now, you need to open the profile file in a text editor to add your customizations. To open the profile in Notepad, run the following command:

    `notepad $Profile` 
    
    This will open the profile file in Notepad.
    
5.  **Add the Alias Configuration:** In Notepad, add the following command to load your alias file:

    `# Replace 'C:\Path\To\Your\Alias\File.ps1' with the actual path to your alias file
    . 'C:\Path\To\Your\Alias\File.ps1'` 
    
    Make sure to replace `'C:\Path\To\Your\Alias\File.ps1'` with the actual path to your alias file. The dot (`.`) at the beginning is essential to execute the script in the current context.
    
6.  **Save and Close Notepad:** Save the changes you made in Notepad and close the editor.
    
7.  **Reload the Profile:** To apply the changes immediately, you can reload the profile by running the following command:

    `. $Profile` 
    
    This will execute the changes you made in the profile script.
    

From now on, every time you start PowerShell, it will automatically read the alias file specified in your profile, and your custom aliases will be available for use in the session.
