# How to Make App-Specific Hotkeys With AutoHotkey
Is your mouse disrupting your workflow? Every time you reach for it, you're losing a tiny bit of focus and time. And have you ever accidentally knocked something over while trying to grab your mouse?

Keep your hands where they are, and study all the [keyboard shortcuts](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-shortcuts-101-ultimate-keyboard-shortcut-guide/) that will put your mouse to shame. To help you save time and increase your productivity, we've put together this list of the most handy Windows, Office, Chrome, and Firefox keyboard shortcuts. We've also included universal keyboard shortcuts that have a function in multiple applications.

Windows
-------

These keyboard shortcuts are specific to Windows. We've tested them on Windows 10, but most also work on previous versions of Windows.

### Turn On High Contrast

**Shift + Alt + Print**

 ![](_assets/Windows-10-High-Contrast.jpg) 

In its default setting, this shortcut opens a warning window before applying any changes. Click **Yes** or simply hit **Return** to switch to the high contrast setting.

This will enlarge the font on all open windows and change colors to high contrast. For example, the desktop will turn black, what was black text on white background before will be reversed. Clicking the same key combination again reverts the changes.

### Rotate Screen

**Ctrl + Alt + up/down/left/right arrow**

This won't work on every machine, as it depends on your graphics card and video drivers. However, if it does work, it will rotate your desktop to [turn your screen on its side or upside down](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-upside-screen-windows-10/).

It's also the quickest way to play a trick on an unsuspecting victim. You can make this change permanent through display settings. Head to the **Settings** app (press Windows key + I) and go to **System > Display**.

Here, you can change the **Orientation** from **Landscape** to **Portrait** or a flipped (upside down) version of the two.

You can reverse the direction by holding **Alt + Shift** while pressing the **Tab** key.

**Windows + Tab**

### Delete a File Without Confirmation

**Shift + Delete**

 ![](_assets/Windows-10-Delete-File.jpg) 

Do you hate these nagging windows asking you whether you really want to do this or that? If you want to quickly delete something, without being harassed for confirmation, use this shortcut.

Do you want to make the instant delete route your default setting? Right-click the **Recycle Bin** on your desktop, select **Properties**, and remove the checkmark next to the **Display delete confirmation dialog**.

Should you ever run into [trouble deleting a file in use](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-ways-delete-file-use-windows/), we've got you covered.

### Show Desktop / Restore Open Windows

**Windows + D**

To see your desktop, press this keyboard shortcut instead of moving your mouse to the bottom right corner of your screen. Press it again to restore your windows exactly as they were before.

### Lock System

**Windows + L**

You should never leave your desktop unattended. Before you leave your desk, press this keyboard shortcut to lock your system. When you return and log back in, all programs and windows will appear the way you left them.

If you can't be bothered to type in your super-secure Microsoft password every time you log back into your desktop, [set a short PIN instead](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/pin-password-use-windows-10/).

### Run Command Prompt as Administrator

**Windows + R >** type **cmd,** hold **Ctrl + Shift,** hit **Enter.**

This is one complex chain of commands. But if you manage to do it right, you'll have instant [Administrator access to the command prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/essential-windows-cmd-commands/).

This shortcut stopped working with the Windows 10 Creators Update, but is working again if you're on a more recent Windows 10 version. Alternatively, press **Windows + X** to open the Quick Access Menu, then use the **up/down** arrow keys to move the **Command Prompt (Admin)** entry, and hit **Enter**.

### Shut Down Windows

**Windows + X, U, I / U / R / H / S**

 ![](_assets/Windows-10-Shut-Down-or-Sign-Out.jpg) 

You can shut Windows down with a few button clicks. It all starts with **Windows + X** to open the Quick Access Menu, followed by the **U** key to expand the **Shut down or sign out** menu. Finally, press **I** to sign out, **U** to shut down, **R** to restart, **H** to hibernate, or **S** to sleep.

### Create Your Own Desktop Keyboard Trick

Are there folders or applications you need a lot? Why not create your own keyboard shortcut to quickly access these tools.

You can use a desktop shortcut for the application, or you can find the root folder. To open an application's program folder in Windows 10, press the **Windows key**, search for it, then right-click the icon and select **Open file location**.

From here, you can right-click the application again, select **Create Shortcut** from the context menu, and click **Yes** to place the shortcut on the desktop. However, you can also proceed with the shortcut sitting in the file location.

Right-click the shortcut and select **Properties**. You should see a line that says **Shortcut Key: None**. Click that line and then click a letter on your keyboard, for example, **I**. This will create a shortcut, here **Ctrl + Alt + I**.

And there you go, now you have your own personal shortcut key.

Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
---------------------------------

Here we've picked keyboard shortcuts that work in both browsers and possibly in other browsers, too.

### Jump to Open Tabs

**Ctrl+ \[tab #1-9\]**

Rather than scrolling through all your open tabs, you can quickly navigate to a specific tab if you know its position. For example, clicking **Ctrl + 4** will jump to tab number 4 (from the left). With **Ctrl + 9** you will jump to the very last tab, no matter how many you have open.

### Move Through Tabs

**Ctrl + Tab or Ctrl + Shift + Tab**

Got too many tabs open for the previous shortcut to be useful? Like in Windows, you can use the **Ctrl + Tab** shortcut to move through all of your open tabs from left to right. Add the **Shift** key to move from right to left.

### Close Tab

**Ctrl + F4**

A quick, mouseless way to close a tab.

### Open Closed Tab/s

**Ctrl + Shift + T**

Did you accidentally close that tab? Restore it using this key combination.

### Scroll PageDown or PageUp

**Spacebar or Shift + Spacebar**

Give your mouse wheel a break and use the spacebar to move up and down a website.

### Toggle Full Screen

**F11**

Quickly change into full-screen mode.

Universal Keyboard Tricks
-------------------------

The following keyboard shortcuts will work in most programs across Windows.

### Undo and Redo

**Ctrl + Z and Ctrl + Y**

I'm sure you all know that you can undo changes using the **Ctrl + Z** shortcut. It's the best shortcut to remember when you've messed up. Yes, we all wish this feature existed in real life.

Did you know that you can also undo an undo, i.e. redo what you did using the **Ctrl + Y** key combination? However, this feature is most useful when you have to repeat a task, like pasting the same information into several locations.

### Close Windows

**Alt + F4**

This will rapidly close the current window in focus. You could also use it to shut down your browser, including all open tabs. Note that **Ctrl + Z** won't work here. And **Ctrl + Shift + T**, i.e. to restore browser tabs, only works if another browser window remains open.

### Zoom

**Ctrl + Mouse Wheel or Touchpad Scroll**

With high-resolution screens, we often find that text on websites is way too small to read properly. Here is a little trick that can quickly increase the font size for better reading. Yes, it does require your mouse, though you could use your touchpad instead.

While you hold down the **Ctrl key**, move your mouse wheel to increase or decrease the font size. When used in the Windows File Explorer, this shortcut will cycle through different Layout settings.

This is useful for making a website fit your window size, rather than to adapt the browser window. Or you could use it to quickly change the zoom level in a Word document. Press **Ctrl + 0** to restore the default zoom level.
