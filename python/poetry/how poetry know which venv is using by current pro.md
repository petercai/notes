# how poetry know which venv is using by current project in windows?

Poetry determines which virtual environment (venv) is used by the current project on Windows primarily through its internal environment management system. By default, Poetry creates and manages a virtual environment for each project, storing it in a system-specific cache directory (on Windows, typically under `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs`) unless configured otherwise[^6].

Here is how Poetry knows and manages the venv for the current project:

- **Automatic Creation and Detection**: When you run Poetry commands in a project directory containing a `pyproject.toml`, Poetry automatically creates a dedicated virtual environment for that project if one does not exist. It keeps track of this environment internally and uses it for running commands and installing dependencies[^4][^6].
- **Listing and Showing the Environment Path**: You can find out which virtual environment Poetry is using for the current project by running:

```
poetry env info --path
```

This command outputs the full path to the virtual environment associated with the project[^2].
- **Activating the Environment**: To activate the Poetry-managed venv in your shell, you can use:

```
poetry shell
```

This launches a subshell with the project's virtual environment activated. Alternatively, you can manually activate it by using the path from `poetry env info --path` and sourcing the activate script (on Windows, this would be something like `.\Scripts\activate`)[^1][^5].
- **Using a Specific Python Version or Existing venv**: You can explicitly tell Poetry which Python interpreter or virtual environment to use for the project with:

```
poetry env use <path-to-python-or-version>
```

This is useful if you want to switch to a different Python version or use an existing virtual environment rather than letting Poetry create one[^1].
- **Respecting Externally Activated venvs**: If you manually activate a virtual environment before running Poetry commands, Poetry detects and respects this active environment instead of creating or switching to its own. This can be configured with:

```
poetry config virtualenvs.prefer-active-python true --local
```

which tells Poetry to use the currently active Python environment[^3][^4].

In summary, Poetry knows which venv to use by either managing it internally in a cache directory per project or by detecting an already activated environment. You can query the current venv path with `poetry env info --path` and activate it with `poetry shell` or manually via the activate script on Windows. You can also explicitly specify which Python or venv to use with `poetry env use` commands[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6].
