# then how poetry manage multiple python environments when it requires a python

Poetry manages multiple Python environments by creating and using isolated virtual environments for each project, but it still requires Python interpreters installed on your system to do so. Here’s how it works in detail:

- **Poetry requires at least one Python interpreter installed on your system**. It uses this interpreter to create virtual environments for your projects. These virtual environments are isolated Python environments that contain their own Python binaries and package installations, separate from the global Python installation[^1][^2].
- When you run Poetry in a project, it first checks if it is already inside a virtual environment. If so, it uses that environment directly. If not, Poetry tries to find a suitable Python interpreter to create a new virtual environment for the project. By default, it uses the Python version that was active when Poetry was installed, but if that version is incompatible with the project’s specified Python version range, Poetry will try to locate another compatible Python interpreter on your system[^1][^2].
- You can explicitly tell Poetry which Python interpreter to use for creating or switching virtual environments using the command `poetry env use <path-to-python>` or by specifying a version like `poetry env use 3.9`. This flexibility allows you to manage multiple Python versions installed on your system and assign them per project[^1][^2].
- Tools like `pyenv` (on Unix-like systems) can help manage multiple Python versions on your machine. Poetry will respect the Python version set by `pyenv` in your shell, using that interpreter to create the virtual environment for the project[^1][^2].
- Poetry stores virtual environments either in a centralized cache directory or optionally inside the project directory (if configured). This separation helps isolate dependencies and Python versions per project without affecting the global Python installation[^6].
- Poetry itself is a Python application and thus cannot run without Python. However, it orchestrates the creation and management of multiple isolated Python environments by leveraging the Python interpreters installed on your system and virtual environment technology[^1][^2][^6].

In summary, Poetry manages multiple Python environments by creating isolated virtual environments using existing Python interpreters installed on your system. It does not bundle Python itself but relies on your system’s Python installations to create and switch between these isolated environments per project.

**References:**

- Poetry manages environments by creating isolated virtual environments using installed Python versions and can switch between them explicitly[^1][^2].
- You can specify which Python interpreter Poetry uses per project with `poetry env use` commands[^1][^2].
- Poetry stores virtual environments separately from the global Python installation, ensuring project isolation[^6].
