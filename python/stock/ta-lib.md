2. (Recommended) Use Pre-built TA-Lib Binaries
Building TA-Lib from source is tricky on Windows. Instead, install the pre-built wheel:

Uninstall any failed TA-Lib install:

Download the correct .whl for your Python version and architecture from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib.

https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build

Install it (replace the filename with the one you downloaded):

3. (Optional) Remove TA_Lib from requirements.txt if not needed
If you don't need it, just remove the TA_Lib line from your requirements.txt.

Summary:

Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools
Or, use a pre-built TA-Lib wheel for your Python version
Then, re-run your install command



To install a `.whl` (wheel) file using **Poetry**, you can't install it directly via `poetry add`, but you **can install it via `pip` inside the virtual environment** managed by Poetry. Here's how:

---

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### 1. **Activate the Poetry Shell**

```bash
poetry shell
```

This drops you into the virtual environment for your project.

#### 2. **Install the `.whl` File with `pip`**

```bash
pip install /path/to/your_package.whl
```

This installs the wheel file into the active Poetry-managed virtual environment.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* **Poetry does not natively support `.whl` files via `poetry add`.** It expects either a PyPI package or a path to a source distribution (`.tar.gz`, `.zip`, or a local directory).
* If you want Poetry to "know" about this dependency, you must manage it manually.

---

### üõ† Optional: Add a Manual Entry to `pyproject.toml`

Since this won‚Äôt update `pyproject.toml` automatically, you could:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
your-package = { path = "./libs/your_package.whl" }
```

But this works **only if Poetry can extract metadata** from the wheel, which isn't guaranteed. Often, the pip method is safer.

---

Would you like a fallback script or helper to manage `.whl` dependencies in a more Poetry-compatible way?
