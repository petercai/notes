# pip in dockerfile

Let's break down the command you're asking about, especially focusing on the `-i` option:

---

### 🧾 **Full Command (cleaned up)**

```Dockerfile
RUN echo "${CA_BUNDLE}" > /tmp/root.pem && \
  python -m pip install \
    --no-cache-dir \
    --cert /tmp/root.pem \
    -i "https://${ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME_READONLY}:${ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD_READONLY}@af.cds.bns/artifactory/api/pypi/virtual-python-bns/simple" \
    -r /app/requirements.txt
```

---

### 🔍 **Explanation of Each Part**

- `echo "${CA_BUNDLE}" > /tmp/root.pem`\ Writes the custom CA certificate to a file so `pip` can use it to trust the internal Artifactory server.
    
- `python -m pip install`\ Runs pip as a module to install Python packages.
    
- `--no-cache-dir`\ Prevents pip from caching packages, reducing image size.
    
- `--cert /tmp/root.pem`\ Tells pip to use the custom certificate for HTTPS verification.
    
- `**-i <index-url>**`\ This is the key part you asked about:
    
    ### 📌 `-i` stands for `--index-url`
    
    It tells pip **which Python package index to use** instead of the default PyPI.
    
    In this case, it's pointing to a **private Artifactory repository**:
    
    ```
    https://<username>:<password>@af.cds.bns/artifactory/api/pypi/virtual-python-bns/simple
    ```
    
    This allows pip to install packages from your organization's internal package registry.
    
- `-r /app/requirements.txt`\ Installs all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Would you like help making this command more secure (e.g., avoiding credentials in the image), or converting it to use environment variables at runtime instead of build time?
