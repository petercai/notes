# how check dependencies version update info in a uv managed project

To check and update dependency versions in a project managed by **uv**, you can follow these steps and use the uv CLI commands designed for dependency management:

## Checking Dependency Versions and Updates in uv

- The dependencies and their version constraints are declared in the `pyproject.toml` file under the `[project]` section, using dependency specifiers compliant with PEP 508 (e.g., `requests>=2.31.0,<3.0.0`)[^1].
- The exact resolved versions of dependencies (including transitive dependencies) are recorded in the `uv.lock` file, which uv manages automatically to ensure reproducible environments[^4][^7].
- To see if updates are available, uv itself does not have a built-in command exactly like `poetry update` or `npm outdated` yet. However, you can upgrade dependencies individually or all at once with some commands described below[^2][^5].


## How to Update Dependencies in uv

- To upgrade a specific package to the latest compatible version according to your version constraints, run:

```
uv lock --upgrade-package <package-name>
```

This updates the lockfile and your environment for that package without changing other dependencies[^3].
- To add or change a dependency version, use:

```
uv add <package-name>[extras]==version
```

For example, to upgrade `requests` to version 2.31.0 explicitly:

```
uv add 'requests==2.31.0'
```

This updates `pyproject.toml` and the lockfile accordingly[^1][^3][^7].
- For adding multiple dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file (useful for migration), use:

```
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

- Currently, there is a feature request for a command like `uv upgrade` to automatically bump all dependency versions in `pyproject.toml` to the latest available, similar to Poetry's update command, but this is not yet implemented[^5].


## Summary of Recommended Workflow

1. Check your `pyproject.toml` for declared version constraints.
2. To update a single dependency, run:

```
uv lock --upgrade-package <dependency>
```

3. To explicitly set or change a dependency version, use:

```
uv add <dependency>==<version>
```

4. After updating dependencies, test your project to ensure compatibility.
5. Commit changes to `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` for reproducibility.

This workflow ensures your dependencies are updated in a controlled manner, with uv managing the lockfile and environment consistency.

This approach reflects the current uv capabilities as of mid-2025; more automated bulk upgrade features may be introduced in the future[^2][^3][^5].
