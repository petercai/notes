# use in team

Using **uv** to manage Python packages in a team can significantly streamline your workflow. Here are the key steps and features to get you started:

### **1. Installing uv**

- **Standalone Installer**: Download and run the installer from the official uv website.
- **PyPI**: Use the command `pip install uv` to install uv from the Python Package Index.

 ### **2. Creating and Managing Projects**

- **Initialize a Project**: Use `uv init` to create a new Python project. This sets up a `pyproject.toml` file and a virtual environment.
- **Run Scripts**: Use `uv run <script>` to execute your project's entry-point script.

### **3. Dependency Management**

- **Add Dependencies**: Use `uv add <package>` to add a new dependency to your project.
- **Install Dependencies**: Use `uv install` to install all dependencies listed in your `pyproject.toml` file.
- **Upgrade/Remove Dependencies**: Use `uv upgrade <package>` and `uv remove <package>` to manage existing dependencies.

### **4. Virtual Environments**

- **Automatic Management**: uv automatically creates and manages virtual environments for your projects, ensuring clean and isolated dependencies.

### **5. Building and Publishing Packages**

- **Build**: Use `uv build` to create a distribution package for your project.
- **Publish**: Use `uv publish` to upload your package to PyPI or another package repository.

### **6. Team Collaboration**

- **Lock and Sync Environments**: Use `uv lock` to create a lock file that ensures consistent environments across different machines. Team members can use `uv sync` to replicate the environment.

### **7. Additional Features**

- **Fast Dependency Resolution**: uv is designed to be significantly faster than traditional tools like pip, thanks to its Rust implementation [[IB from chatgpt]](https://realpython.com/python-uv/) [[2]](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-uv).
- **Compatibility**: uv works seamlessly with existing tools and workflows, making it easy to integrate into your team's processes [[2]](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-uv).

By leveraging these features, your team can manage Python projects more efficiently, ensuring smooth development and deployment processes.

# requirments.txt -> project.toml


To convert a Python project with a `requirements.txt` file to a `uv` project with a `pyproject.toml`, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the `uv` project**:

```sh
   uv init
```

2. **Delete unnecessary files**: Remove any files created by `uv` that you don't need, such as `hello.py`.
    
3. **Modify `pyproject.toml`**: Update the `pyproject.toml` file with information from your `setup.py` (e.g., description, authors).
    
4. **Add dependencies from `requirements.txt`**:
    

```sh
   uv add -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Remove `setup.py`**: Delete the `setup.py` file as it's no longer needed.
    
6. **Install the project**:
    

```sh
   uv pip install -e .
```

7. **Update Makefile**: Modify your Makefile to use `uv` commands instead of `pip`.

```makefile
   install_library:
       uv sync
       uv pip install -e .

   run_a_script:
       uv run python ./my_lib/my_script.py

   launch_test:
       uv run pytest -n auto --cov-report=xml
```

8. **Update CI configuration**: If you use CI (e.g., GitHub Actions), update your CI scripts to use `uv`.

```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Install uv
           uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
         - name: Set up Python environment
           run: |
             make install_library
         - name: Test with pytest
           run: |
             make launch_test
```

9. **Deploy on PyPI**: Use `uv` to build and publish your project.

```sh
   uv build
   uv publish
```

# install pip in uv
The error you're seeing — **`No module named pip`** when running `python -m pip` inside a `uv`-created virtual environment — usually means that `pip` was **not installed** in that environment.

### 🔍 Why This Happens in `uv`:

`uv` creates **minimal virtual environments** by default, which may **not include `pip`** unless explicitly requested or unless the environment is synced with dependencies.

---

### ✅ How to Fix It

#### Option 1: Use `uv` to install `pip` into the venv

If you're inside the virtual environment, run:

```Shell
uv pip install pip
```

#### Option 2: Recreate the venv with `pip` included

If you're creating a new venv and want to ensure `pip` is available:

```Shell
uv venv --python python3 --pip
```

> Note: If `--pip` is not recognized, it may not be supported in your version. In that case, proceed with Option 1 after creating the venv.

#### Option 3: Use `ensurepip` (if available)

If `ensurepip` is available in your Python interpreter:

```Shell
python -m ensurepip
```
