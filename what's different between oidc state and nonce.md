# what's different between oidc state and nonce
In OpenID Connect (OIDC), `state` and `nonce` are both parameters used to provide security and protection against attacks in the authentication flow. However, they serve different purposes:

1.  `state`: A value generated by the client and passed to the authorization server in the authorization request. It helps to maintain the state of the user's session and prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The authorization server returns the same `state` value in the redirect back to the client, and the client should verify that the `state` value is the same as the one it sent.
    
2.  `nonce`: A value generated by the client and passed to the authorization server in the authorization request. It helps to prevent replay attacks by ensuring that an authorization code returned from the authorization server is used only once and for the intended user. The authorization server includes the `nonce` value in the ID token, and the client should verify that the `nonce` value matches the one it sent.
    

In summary, `state` is used to maintain the state of the user's session and prevent CSRF attacks, while `nonce` is used to prevent replay attacks and ensure that an authorization code is used only once for the intended user.
