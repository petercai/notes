# JwtDecorder

In a Spring Boot 3 application, the `JwtDecoder` bean is typically used in the **security configuration** to decode and validate JWT tokens. This bean is essential for applications that implement OAuth2 resource servers, where it helps verify the authenticity and integrity of JWT tokens received from clients.

Here's a common usage scenario:

1. **Security Configuration**: The `JwtDecoder` bean is often referenced in the security configuration class to set up JWT-based authentication. For example:

```java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2ResourceServer()
                .jwt()
                .decoder(jwtDecoder());
    }
}
```

2. **Resource Server**: When your application acts as a resource server, it uses the `JwtDecoder` bean to decode incoming JWT tokens and validate them against the JWK set URI provided [[IB from chatgpt]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66967775/i-need-a-jwtdecoder-bean-can-i-autoconfigure-this) [[2]](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-oauth-jwt).
    
3. **Token Validation**: The `JwtDecoder` bean ensures that the JWT tokens are properly validated, checking the signature and claims to confirm that the token is issued by a trusted authorization server [[3]](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html).

# oauth2ResourceServer

```
http.oauth2ResourceServer(  
    resourceServer ->  
        resourceServer  
            .authenticationEntryPoint(authenticationEntryPoint)  
            .accessDeniedHandler(accessDeniedExceptionHandler)  
            .jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));
```

```
public class JwtConfigurer {  
  
    private final ApplicationContext context;  
  
    private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;  
  
    private JwtDecoder decoder;
```


In the code snippet you provided, the `JwtDecoder` bean is implicitly called when configuring the OAuth2 resource server with JWT support. Specifically, the `jwt(Customizer.withDefaults())` method triggers the use of the `JwtDecoder` bean that you've defined.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **OAuth2 Resource Server Configuration**: The `http.oauth2ResourceServer()` method configures the application to act as an OAuth2 resource server.
    
2. **JWT Configuration**: Within this configuration, the `resourceServer.jwt(Customizer.withDefaults())` method sets up JWT-based authentication. This method relies on the default `JwtDecoder` bean provided by Spring Security[[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66967775/i-need-a-jwtdecoder-bean-can-i-autoconfigure-this)[[1]](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-oauth-jwt).
    
3. **Bean Invocation**: When the resource server receives a JWT token, it uses the `JwtDecoder` bean to decode and validate the token. The `Customizer.withDefaults()` ensures that the default configuration, including the `JwtDecoder` bean, is applied[[3]](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html).
    

So, while the `JwtDecoder` bean isn't explicitly called in your code snippet, it is utilized by the framework to handle JWT token decoding and validation.
