# "Mean," "Median," And "Mode" – What's The Difference? | Dictionary.com
Though we commonly use the word _average_ in everyday life when discussing the number that’s the most “typical” or that’s “in the middle” of a group of values, more precise terms are used in math and statistics. Namely, the words _mean_, _median_, and _mode_ each represent a different calculation or interpretation of which value in a data set is the most common or most representative of the set as a whole.

In this article, we’ll answer these questions and more:

*   Is there a difference between _mean_ and _average_?
*   What’s the difference between _mean_, _median_, and _mode_?
*   How do you find the _mean_, _median_, and _mode_?

⚡ **Quick summary**
-------------------

You find the _mean_ (informally called the _average_) by adding up all the numbers in a set and then dividing by how many values there are. When you arrange a set of values from smallest to largest, the _median_ is the one in the middle. The _mode_ is simply the value that occurs the most in the set.

**_mean_ vs. _average_**
------------------------

In math, the word _mean_ refers to what’s informally called the _average_. They mean the same thing, but in the context of math and statistics, it’s better to use the word _mean_ to distinguish from other things that might be casually referred to as “average” values in a general sense (meaning values that are the most representative or common within the set).

**What is the _mean_, _median_, and _mode_?**
---------------------------------------------

The _mean_ is the number you get by dividing the sum of a set of values by the number of values in the set.

In contrast, the _median_ is the middle number in a set of values when those values are arranged from smallest to largest.

The _mode_ of a set of values is the most frequently repeated value in the set.

To illustrate the difference, let’s look at a very simple example.

**How to find the _mean_, _median_, and _mode_**
------------------------------------------------

Here’s an example set of seven values: 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.

**To find the _mean_:** add up all the values (2+3+3+4+6+8+9=35) and then divide that total by the number of values (7), resulting in a _mean_ of 5. This is what most people are referring to when they refer to the _average_ of some set of numbers.

**To find the _median_:** find the value that’s sequentially in the middle. In a set of seven numbers arranged in increasing value, the median is the fourth number (since there are three before and three after). In this set (2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9), the _median_ is 4. When a set has an even number of values, the _median_ is the mean of the two middle values (in other words, you find the _median_ by adding the two middle numbers together and dividing by two).

**To find the _mode_:** simply look to see which value shows up the most. In the example set, the _mode_ is 3, since it occurs twice and all the other values occur only once.

Of course, this set of values is very simple compared to data sets you’re likely to encounter in real life. In cases when there is too much data to look at all at once, there are often special tools (such as those used in spreadsheet software) that you can use to determine the mean, median, and mode.
