# db.create_all()

In Flask-SQLAlchemy, `db.create_all()` is a method used to create all the database tables that correspond to the models you've defined in your Flask application. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Looks at the models**: It inspects all the models (classes) that inherit from `db.Model`. These models define the structure of your database tables (like table name, columns, data types, relationships, etc.).

2. **Creates the tables**: It creates the tables in the database if they don't already exist. This method does not modify or drop any existing tablesâ€”its primary purpose is to create tables that do not exist yet.

3. **Uses the bound database engine**: The method connects to the database configured in your Flask app (typically through the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` setting) and executes the necessary SQL commands to create the tables.

For example, if you define a model like this:

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
```

When you call `db.create_all()`, it will create the corresponding `User` table in your database if it doesn't already exist.

### Important Notes:
- **Migrations**: `db.create_all()` is mainly useful for small projects or initial database setup. For more complex apps where you need to handle database schema changes over time (like adding or modifying columns), it's better to use a migration tool like Flask-Migrate or Alembic, which provides better control over schema changes without data loss.
- **No Updates**: It only creates missing tables; it does not update existing tables or modify their schemas if they change in your models. You need migrations for that.
