# How can I verify which host Istio uses for routing when multiple destinations are configured

You can verify which destination host Istio uses for routing in several ways:

### 1. Use `istioctl` to describe the VirtualService and routing rules

Run:

```bash
istioctl analyze
istioctl proxy-config routes <pod-name> -n <namespace>
istioctl proxy-config clusters <pod-name> -n <namespace>
istioctl x describe pod <pod-name>
```

- `istioctl proxy-config routes` shows the Envoy route configuration, including which destination hosts traffic is routed to.
- `istioctl x describe pod` shows what DestinationRules apply to the pod and which subsets are matched.
- This helps you see the actual routing decisions Envoy will make based on the VirtualService.


### 2. Inspect the VirtualService YAML

- The `spec.hosts` field lists the **client-visible hostnames** that trigger this VirtualService.
- The `spec.http.route.destination.host` fields specify the **actual backend Kubernetes service names** (or service entries) to which traffic is routed.
- If multiple destinations exist with weights, traffic is split accordingly.


### 3. Check Envoy access logs on the sidecar proxy

- Access logs show which upstream cluster (destination host) requests are forwarded to.
- This is useful to confirm runtime routing behavior.


### 4. Use telemetry and tracing tools

- Tools like Kiali, Jaeger, or Grafana integrated with Istio can visualize traffic flow and show which destinations receive traffic.

### Summary

| Method | What it shows |
| :-- | :-- |
| `istioctl proxy-config routes` | Envoy route configuration, destination hosts |
| `istioctl x describe pod` | DestinationRules and subsets applied to pod |
| Envoy access logs | Actual upstream clusters receiving traffic |
| Telemetry/tracing tools | Visual traffic flow and routing paths |


---

### Notes from Istio docs

- The `destination.host` must match a service in Istio’s registry (usually a Kubernetes service).
- Short names in `destination.host` are resolved relative to the VirtualService namespace.
- Routing rules are matched in order; the first matching rule applies.
- Weighted destinations split traffic proportionally.

---

**In brief:**
Use `istioctl proxy-config routes` and `istioctl x describe pod` commands to inspect which destination hosts Istio routes traffic to, and verify with Envoy logs or telemetry tools for runtime confirmation.
