# How does spec.http.route.destination.host relate to the actual service name

The `spec.http.route.destination.host` in an Istio VirtualService specifies the **actual backend service name** inside the mesh to which the traffic should be routed. This host should unambiguously refer to a service registered in Istio’s service registry, which typically includes Kubernetes services.

### Relation to the actual Kubernetes service name:

- If you specify a **short name** like `provisioning-ist-nane2`, Istio interprets it relative to the namespace of the VirtualService. For example, if the VirtualService is in namespace `default`, `provisioning-ist-nane2` resolves to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) `provisioning-ist-nane2.default.svc.cluster.local`.
- You can also specify the **fully qualified domain name** (FQDN) explicitly, e.g., `provisioning-ist-nane2.default.svc.cluster.local`, to avoid ambiguity.
- This host corresponds directly to the Kubernetes Service resource that fronts your pods. Istio uses this to discover endpoints and route traffic accordingly.


### Summary from the official Istio docs [^1][^3]:

- The `destination.host` in the route must match a service in the service registry (usually a Kubernetes Service).
- Short names are resolved based on the namespace of the VirtualService.
- It is recommended to use FQDNs to avoid misconfiguration.
- The VirtualService routes traffic to this service after matching the incoming request’s host and URI.


### Example:

```yaml
http:
  - route:
      - destination:
          host: provisioning-ist-nane2       # Kubernetes service name (short form)
          port:
            number: 80
```

This tells Istio to route matched requests to the Kubernetes Service named `provisioning-ist-nane2` on port 80.

### Clarifications from related questions [^2][^6]:

- `spec.http.route.destination.host` **does NOT refer to the VirtualService name or DestinationRule name**; it refers to the backend service hostname.
- The DestinationRule is a separate resource that applies policies (e.g., subsets, load balancing) to traffic destined for that service but does not change the service hostname.
- The VirtualService’s `hosts` field defines the external or client-visible hostnames (Host header) that trigger this routing, while the `destination.host` defines the internal backend service to route to.

### In brief

| Field | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| `spec.hosts` (VirtualService) | Incoming request hostnames (Host header) |
| `spec.http.route.destination.host` | Kubernetes service name inside the mesh |

**Summary:**
The `spec.http.route.destination.host` in your VirtualService should be set to the Kubernetes Service name (short or fully qualified) that you want Istio to route traffic to. This is how Istio knows which backend service to send matched requests to inside the cluster.
