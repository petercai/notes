# How does Istio handle traffic when multiple destination.hosts are defined in one route

When multiple `destination.host`s are defined in one `http.route` in an Istio VirtualService, Istio handles traffic by **splitting or load balancing the incoming requests among those destinations according to specified weights**.

### How it works:

- The `http.route` field contains a list of route destinations, each with a `host` (service name) and an optional `weight`.
- Istio’s Envoy proxy uses these weights to distribute traffic proportionally. For example, if you have two destinations with weights 70 and 30, 70% of the traffic goes to the first host and 30% to the second.
- If weights are not specified, Istio defaults to equal distribution among the destinations.
- This enables advanced traffic management scenarios like **canary deployments, A/B testing, gradual rollouts**, and **blue-green deployments**.


### Example:

```yaml
http:
  - route:
      - destination:
          host: service-v1
          subset: v1
        weight: 80
      - destination:
          host: service-v2
          subset: v2
        weight: 20
```

Here, 80% of the traffic is routed to `service-v1` subset `v1`, and 20% to `service-v2` subset `v2`.

### Additional details from Istio docs and best practices:

- The `destination.host` must be a valid service in Istio’s service registry (usually a Kubernetes service).
- Traffic routing rules in VirtualService are evaluated in order, and the first matching rule applies.
- DestinationRules complement VirtualServices by defining subsets and traffic policies (load balancing, connection pools) for these hosts.
- Envoy proxies perform load balancing using policies like least requests by default, but these can be customized.
- This weighted routing is transparent to the client and managed entirely by Istio’s control plane and sidecar proxies.

### Summary table

| Feature | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Multiple `destination.host`s | Supported in one `http.route` for traffic splitting |
| Traffic distribution | Controlled by `weight` on each destination |
| Default behavior | Equal distribution if no weights specified |
| Use cases | Canary releases, A/B testing, blue-green deployments |
| Load balancing | Envoy applies weighted load balancing among destinations |

### In brief

Istio handles multiple `destination.host`s in one route by **splitting incoming traffic according to the weights assigned**, enabling fine-grained control over how requests are distributed among different service versions or entirely different services.
