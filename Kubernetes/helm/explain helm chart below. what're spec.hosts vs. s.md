# explain helm chart below. what're spec.hosts vs. spec.http.route.destination.host?

# Source: authsvc-cdb-int-crd-pr-helm/templates/virtualservice.yaml

apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3

Certainly! Let's break down the key parts of this Istio **VirtualService** Helm template and explain the difference between `spec.hosts` and `spec.http.route.destination.host`.

## Overview of the VirtualService YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: provisioning-ist-nane2-vs
spec:
  gateways:
    - "istio-ingress/ingress-gateway"
  hosts:
  - cdb-int-credential-provisioning-ist-nane2.nonp.atlas.bns
  - cdb-int-credential-provisioning-ist.nonp.atlas.bns
  http:
    - match:
        - uri:
            prefix: /
      route:
        - destination:
            host: provisioning-ist-nane2
            port:
              number: 80
```

## What is `spec.hosts`?

- **Definition:**
`spec.hosts` is a list of **hostnames** that this VirtualService applies to. These are the **requested hostnames** in the incoming HTTP requests' `Host` header.
- **Purpose:**
It tells Istio which hostnames this VirtualService should handle. When a request arrives at the gateway with a matching `Host` header, Istio applies this VirtualServiceâ€™s routing rules.
- **In your example:**
The VirtualService applies to requests with hostnames:
    - `cdb-int-credential-provisioning-ist-nane2.nonp.atlas.bns`
    - `cdb-int-credential-provisioning-ist.nonp.atlas.bns`
- **Where these hosts are used:**
Typically, these hostnames are DNS names clients use to access your service, and they must be resolvable and routed to the Istio ingress gateway.

---

## What is `spec.http.route.destination.host`?

- **Definition:**
This is the **name of the Kubernetes service** (or service entry) inside the mesh where the traffic should be routed.
- **Purpose:**
It tells Istio **where to send the incoming traffic** that matches the HTTP route rules.
- **In your example:**
Traffic matching the HTTP route (all URIs with prefix `/`) will be forwarded to the service named `provisioning-ist-nane2` on port 80.
- **How it works:**
Istio uses the service name to locate the service endpoints (pods) inside the mesh and load balance traffic accordingly.

## Relationship between `spec.hosts` and `spec.http.route.destination.host`

| Aspect | `spec.hosts` | `spec.http.route.destination.host` |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Represents | Incoming request **hostnames** (Host header) | Destination Kubernetes service inside the mesh |
| Purpose | Defines which hostnames this VirtualService applies to | Defines where to route matching traffic |
| Scope | External-facing or client-visible hostnames | Internal service names within the cluster |
| Example in your YAML | `cdb-int-credential-provisioning-ist-nane2.nonp.atlas.bns` | `provisioning-ist-nane2` (Kubernetes service) |


---

## Summary

- **`spec.hosts`**: The **hostnames clients use** to access your service through the Istio ingress gateway. Istio matches requests based on these host headers.
- **`spec.http.route.destination.host`**: The **internal service name** where Istio forwards the matched requests inside the Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Additional notes

- The `gateways` field (`istio-ingress/ingress-gateway`) indicates this VirtualService is attached to the Istio ingress gateway in the `istio-ingress` namespace.
- The `match` section routes all requests with URI prefix `/` to the destination service.

If you want, I can also help you understand how to adjust this for your local Minikube environment or how it fits into the overall Istio routing!
