# can I setup multiple destination.host in http.route? if yes, how it will work?

Yes, you can specify **multiple destinations** under `http.route` in a single Istio VirtualService, and this is a common way to implement traffic splitting or load balancing between different backend services or subsets.

---

### How multiple destinations in `http.route` work

- The `http.route` field contains a list of `destination` objects.
- Each `destination` specifies a backend service (`host`) and optionally a subset or port.
- You assign a `weight` to each destination, which Istio uses to distribute traffic proportionally.
- Istio’s Envoy proxy performs weighted load balancing based on these weights.

---

### Example with multiple destinations and weights:

```yaml
http:
  - route:
      - destination:
          host: service-v1
          subset: v1
        weight: 70
      - destination:
          host: service-v2
          subset: v2
        weight: 30
```

This routes 70% of matching requests to `service-v1` subset `v1` and 30% to `service-v2` subset `v2`.

---

### Important points:

- All destinations must be within the same VirtualService’s `hosts` scope.
- The sum of weights should ideally be 100 (not strictly required, but recommended).
- Destinations can point to the same Kubernetes service with different subsets (versions) or to different services.
- This enables canary releases, A/B testing, or gradual rollouts.

---

### How it works internally:

- When a request matches the VirtualService’s `hosts` and `http.match` conditions, Istio’s Envoy proxy consults the route.
- Envoy uses the weights to randomly select a destination according to the configured distribution.
- Traffic is then forwarded to the selected backend service.

---

### References from search results:

- Istio docs confirm a single VirtualService can describe traffic properties for multiple HTTP routes and destinations[^1][^8].
- Traffic splitting with multiple weighted destinations is a common pattern in Istio VirtualService configuration[^4][^7].
- Multiple VirtualServices for the same host should be merged into one to avoid conflicts, consolidating all routes and destinations[^2][^5].

### Summary

| Feature | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Multiple destinations in route | Supported via a list under `http.route` |
| Traffic distribution | Controlled by `weight` on each destination |
| Use cases | Canary deployments, A/B testing, gradual rollouts |
| Restrictions | Destinations must be valid services in the mesh |


---

**In brief:**
You can list multiple `destination.host` entries in the `http.route` section of a VirtualService, each with a weight to control traffic distribution. Istio will load balance requests among these destinations according to the specified weights.
