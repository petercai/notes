# PCF vs. GKE

Great question! Let's break this down into two parts:

---

## üîÅ **1. Key Differences Between Auto-Scaling in PCF vs GKE**

|Feature|**PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry)**|**GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Scaling Unit**|App instances (replicas of the app)|Pods (via HPA) and Nodes (via Cluster Autoscaler)|
|**Trigger Types**|CPU, memory, HTTP throughput, response time|CPU, memory, custom metrics (via Prometheus, Cloud Monitoring)|
|**Scale From Zero**|Not supported natively|Not supported by HPA alone; possible with KEDA|
|**Configuration**|YAML or via PCF CLI|YAML manifests (HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler)|
|**Granularity**|App-level|Pod-level and cluster-level|
|**Autoscaler Type**|App Autoscaler|Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA), Cluster Autoscaler|

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Translating PCF Auto-Scaling Settings to GKE

You mentioned this PCF rule:

```Yaml
rule_type: "cpu"
threshold:
  min: 16
  max: 43
```

This means:

- **Scale down** when CPU usage is below **16%**
- **Scale up** when CPU usage exceeds **43%**

### ‚úÖ Equivalent in GKE (HPA):

In GKE, HPA uses a **target average CPU utilization**, not min/max thresholds. So you‚Äôd typically set:

```Yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: your-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: your-app
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 43
```

### üß† Notes:

- GKE HPA **does not support a lower threshold** like PCF does. It only scales **up** when the target is exceeded.
- If you want to **scale down more aggressively**, you can set a **lower `averageUtilization`**, like `30` or `25`, but not below `20` in most cases (to avoid flapping).
- For **scale-to-zero**, you'd need **KEDA** or a custom scaler.

# best practices

When I said **"not below 20 in most cases (to avoid flapping)"**, I was referring to a common **best practice in Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** configuration.

---

### üîÅ What is **flapping**?

**Flapping** means the system is **constantly scaling up and down** in a short period of time. This can happen when:

- The CPU usage hovers around the threshold.
- The threshold is set **too low**, causing the HPA to **scale down too aggressively**.
- Then, as load increases slightly, it **scales up again**, and the cycle repeats.

This leads to:

- **Unstable performance**
- **Increased resource churn**
- **Higher latency or cold starts**

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why is `20%` a common lower bound?

In practice, setting `averageUtilization` **below 20%** often leads to flapping because:

- CPU usage naturally fluctuates.
- At very low thresholds, even small spikes can trigger scaling.
- Kubernetes HPA doesn't have built-in hysteresis (like a buffer zone), so it reacts quickly to changes.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice

- Set `averageUtilization` to **30‚Äì60%** for most workloads.
- Avoid going below **20%** unless you're using **custom metrics** or **advanced tuning**.
- Use **cooldown periods** or **stabilization windows** (available in `autoscaling/v2`) to reduce flapping.

# cooldown periods and stabilization windows

Great question! In Kubernetes, **cooldown periods** and **stabilization windows** are mechanisms to help prevent **flapping** (frequent up/down scaling) by adding **delays or buffers** before scaling actions are taken.

---

## üîÅ **1. Stabilization Windows (HPA)**

Introduced in **`autoscaling/v2`**, stabilization windows define how long the HPA should **wait before applying a scaling decision**, even if metrics suggest scaling.

### üîπ Types:

- **`scaleUp` stabilization window**: Waits before increasing replicas.
- **`scaleDown` stabilization window**: Waits before decreasing replicas.

### ‚úÖ Example:

```Yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  behavior:
    scaleUp:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
      policies:
        - type: Percent
          value: 100
          periodSeconds: 15
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
      policies:
        - type: Percent
          value: 50
          periodSeconds: 15
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 50
```

### üîç What this does:

- **Scale up** decisions are delayed by **60 seconds**.
- **Scale down** decisions are delayed by **300 seconds** (5 minutes).
- This helps avoid reacting to short-lived spikes or dips.

---

## üßä **2. Cooldown Periods (PCF)**

In **PCF**, cooldown periods are similar but simpler:

- You define a **cooldown time** after a scaling action.
- During this time, **no further scaling** is allowed.
- Helps avoid rapid back-to-back scaling.

---

## üÜö Summary

|Feature|**PCF**|**GKE (HPA v2)**|
|---|---|---|
|Name|Cooldown Period|Stabilization Window|
|Purpose|Delay next scaling action|Delay applying scaling decision|
|Granularity|Global|Separate for scale-up and scale-down|
|Configurable?|Yes|Yes (in `behavior` block)|

---

Absolutely! Let's dive into **scaling policies** in Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), especially as defined in the `autoscaling/v2` API.

---

## üîß What Are Scaling Policies?

**Scaling policies** define **how fast** and **how much** the HPA is allowed to scale your application **up or down**. They give you **fine-grained control** over scaling behavior to avoid sudden spikes or drops in replica count.

---

## üß± Structure of a Scaling Policy

Each scaling direction (`scaleUp` or `scaleDown`) can have:

- **`stabilizationWindowSeconds`**: How long to wait before applying a scaling decision.
- **`policies`**: A list of rules that define how much scaling is allowed.
- **`selectPolicy`**: How to choose among multiple policies (`Max`, `Min`, or `Disabled`).

---

## üß© Example

```Yaml
behavior:
  scaleUp:
    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 60
    selectPolicy: Max
    policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 100
        periodSeconds: 15
      - type: Pods
        value: 4
        periodSeconds: 15
  scaleDown:
    stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300
    selectPolicy: Max
    policies:
      - type: Percent
        value: 50
        periodSeconds: 30
```

---

## üîç Explanation

### üîº `scaleUp`:

- **Stabilization window**: Wait 60 seconds before applying a scale-up decision.
- **Policies**:
    - Can increase replicas by **100%** (e.g., from 4 to 8) every **15 seconds**.
    - Or increase by **4 pods** every **15 seconds**.
- **`selectPolicy: Max`**: Use the policy that allows the **most aggressive** scaling.

### üîΩ `scaleDown`:

- **Stabilization window**: Wait 5 minutes before scaling down.
- **Policy**: Can reduce replicas by **50%** every **30 seconds**.
- **`selectPolicy`** defaults to `Max` if not specified.

---

## üß† Tips

- Use **`Percent`** for proportional scaling (e.g., double the pods).
- Use **`Pods`** for fixed-step scaling (e.g., add/remove 2 pods at a time).
- Use **`selectPolicy: Min`** if you want to scale more conservatively.
- Use **`Disabled`** to turn off scaling in one direction.
