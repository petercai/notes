# endpoint

To access the `/health` endpoint of your microservice deployed through the Helm chart into Minikube on your local macOS, follow these steps:

1. **Expose the Service**:
   Ensure your service is accessible from outside the cluster. You can use `kubectl port-forward` to forward the port to your local machine:
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward svc/provisioning-ist-nane2 8080:80
   ```

2. **Access the Endpoint**:
   Once the port is forwarded, you can access the `/health` endpoint using `curl` or a web browser:
   ```sh
   curl http://localhost:8080/private/health
   ```

3. **Verify Probes**:
   Your deployment configuration already includes `startupProbe`, `livenessProbe`, and `readinessProbe` for the `/private/health` endpoint. Ensure these probes are functioning correctly by checking the pod status:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
   ```

# cmd

Sure! The command `kubectl port-forward svc/provisioning-ist-nane2 8080:80` is used to forward a local port to a port on a Kubernetes service. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does:

- **`kubectl`**: This is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
- **`port-forward`**: This command sets up port forwarding, allowing you to access a service running in the cluster from your local machine.
- **`svc/provisioning-ist-nane2`**: This specifies the target service in the Kubernetes cluster. `svc` indicates that the target is a service, and `provisioning-ist-nane2` is the name of the service.
- **`8080:80`**: This specifies the port mapping. The first number (`8080`) is the local port on your machine, and the second number (`80`) is the port on the service in the cluster.

When you run this command, it forwards traffic from `localhost:8080` on your local machine to port `80` on the `provisioning-ist-nane2` service in the Kubernetes cluster. This allows you to access the service as if it were running locally on your machine.
