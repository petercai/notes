The [British Museum](http://www.britishmuseum.org/) in London is one of England’s largest, oldest and most comprehensive museums, with its permanent collections housing over 8 million works and articles. Through its exhibits and collections, this museum takes you back to the birth of mankind and civilization. The British Museum is dedicated to documenting and showcasing the evolution and culture of humankind, with exhibits from all over the world.

### British Museum History

The British Museum in London is the world’s first national public museum, established in the year 1753. The exhibits and items on display at the museum are largely based on the collections of [Sir Hans Sloane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Sloane), an Irish physician and scientist. Although the museum didn’t start out with much (71,000 objects), over the course of the last two and half centuries, it has undergone several changes, including widespread renovations and expansions, in order to accommodate the ever-growing collection.

Today, the British Museum, London is home to one of the most extensive and comprehensive collections of artefacts, sculptures, paintings, statues, manuscripts and other antiquities, all collected from around the globe and all dedicated to showcasing the leaps and bounds of human history.

### British Museum Architecture

The British Museum was designed in the Greek Revival style, emulating the classical Greek architecture, with columns, a decorative pediment at the south entrance and a main quadrangle and 4 wings. The core of the building was designed by [Sir Robert Smirke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smirke_(architect)), at the time an eminent and established neoclassical architect. Smirke began the project with the construction of the east wing meant for the King’s Library, (today, considered one of the greatest examples of neoclassical interiors in London) and consequently moved onto the other wings.

What is most striking about the building is its exterior, built decoratively and beautifully so as to convey to its onlookers about the treasures and wondrous objects stored inside. Considering that the museum went through several expansions and restorations, a number of other architects worked on some of the newer areas and wings, including Sydney Smirke, Sir John Taylor and John Russell Pope, all adding to the allure and beauty of the museum we see today.

When visiting the British Museum, the [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) should be on the top of your list of ‘must-see items’.

It is the most popular exhibit at the museum.

These are a collection of beautiful classical Greek marble sculptures that were a part of the Temple of Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens.

### 10\. The Portland Vase

Part of the Roman Empire exhibit, the [Portland Vase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Vase) is a cameo glass vessel, dated somewhere between AD 1 and AD 25. It is assumed to be a wedding gift, because of the depictions and pictures on it of love, sex and marriage, but no one knows for sure. Interestingly enough, the vase was destroyed in the 19th century and it was restored several times based on a copy made of the vase by Wedgwood, which in turn was also a masterpiece!
