### British Museum History

The British Museum in London is the world’s first national public museum, established in the year 1753. The exhibits and items on display at the museum are largely based on the collections of [Sir Hans Sloane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Sloane), an Irish physician and scientist. Although the museum didn’t start out with much (71,000 objects), over the course of the last two and half centuries, it has undergone several changes, including widespread renovations and expansions, in order to accommodate the ever-growing collection.

Today, the British Museum, London is home to one of the most extensive and comprehensive collections of artefacts, sculptures, paintings, statues, manuscripts and other antiquities, all collected from around the globe and all dedicated to showcasing the leaps and bounds of human history.

### British Museum Architecture

The British Museum was designed in the Greek Revival style, emulating the classical Greek architecture, with columns, a decorative pediment at the south entrance and a main quadrangle and 4 wings. The core of the building was designed by [Sir Robert Smirke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smirke_(architect)), at the time an eminent and established neoclassical architect. Smirke began the project with the construction of the east wing meant for the King’s Library, (today, considered one of the greatest examples of neoclassical interiors in London) and consequently moved onto the other wings.

What is most striking about the building is its exterior, built decoratively and beautifully so as to convey to its onlookers about the treasures and wondrous objects stored inside. Considering that the museum went through several expansions and restorations, a number of other architects worked on some of the newer areas and wings, including Sydney Smirke, Sir John Taylor and John Russell Pope, all adding to the allure and beauty of the museum we see today.

### 3\. Hoa Hakananai'a (The Easter Island Statue)

[Hoa Hakananai'a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoa_Hakananai%27a) is an original Easter Island statue, made of Basalt.

### 4\. The Sutton Hoo Mask and Ship Burial Collection

Considered one of the most important archaeological discoveries made in Britain, the [Sutton Hoo helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Hoo_helmet) is a decorated Anglo-Saxon artefact that was found, along with a whole host of other items, during the excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship burial. This helmet is believed to be that of King Raedwald of East Anglia, given its elaborate and ornate decoration.  
**Location - Ground Floor, Room 2**

### 5\. The Lewis Chessmen

Made out of Walrus ivory and whalebone, these are not your ordinary chess pieces.

Currently, 82 of the 93 pieces found are on display the British Museum, while the remaining 11 are at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  
**Location - Upper Floor, Room 40**

**Location - Ground Floor, Room 4**

### 8\. Assyrian Lion Hunt Reliefs

In ancient Assyria, lion hunting was done for sport, where captured Asian lions were released from cages for kings to kill using swords, spears or arrows.

**Location - Ground Floor, Room 10A**

Part of the Roman Empire exhibit, the [Portland Vase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Vase) is a cameo glass vessel, dated somewhere between AD 1 and AD 25.

Interestingly enough, the vase was destroyed in the 19th century and it was restored several times based on a copy made of the vase by Wedgwood, which in turn was also a masterpiece!

Insider Tips for Visiting the British Museum in London
------------------------------------------------------

* * *

*   Although entry to the British Museum is **free**, it is highly recommended to take a guided tour of the collections. As mentioned earlier, there is just so much to see and explore and it can get pretty overwhelming. Having a guide will help you skip through all the noise and focus on the important exhibitions.
*   Avoid going to the British Museum on school and public holidays. During these days, the museum gets horribly crowded and the lines to enter can stretch on forever. Save yourself the trouble and visit on weekdays.
*   Once you enter the British Museum, tackle the popular attractions first. We'd recommend you head to the Rosetta Stone and Elgin Marbles first as these exhibits will take up most of your time.
*   Have an action plan. Make a list of all the items and artefacts you want to see beforehand. This will not only help you save time but also a ton of energy.
*   If you’re not sure what you want to see, take the [Around the World in 90 Minutes Tour](http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/events_calendar/around_the_world_in_90_minutes.aspx), which takes place on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. For £12 you will be able to see all the important sites in the museum in 90 minutes!
*   If you don’t want to rush and take your time to see everything the museum has to offer, take multiple visits of the museum. Since it has free entry, you can go a bunch of times.
