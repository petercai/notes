The error message you're encountering indicates that your request to list container clusters is being blocked by your organization's policy. This is likely due to restrictions set by your organization's VPC Service Controls, which are designed to enhance security by limiting access to specific resources.

### **Root Cause**

The error `code=403, message=Request is prohibited by organization's policy` suggests that your organization's security policies are preventing the `gcloud` command from executing. This could be due to:

1. **VPC Service Controls**: Your organization has set up VPC Service Controls to restrict access to certain Google Cloud resources [[IB from chatgpt]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35928534/403-request-had-insufficient-authentication-scopes-during-gcloud-container-clu).
2. **IAM Policies**: Your user account may not have the necessary permissions to list container clusters [[2]](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/troubleshooting/kubectl).

### **Solution**

1. **Check VPC Service Controls**:
    
    - Verify if your request is being blocked by VPC Service Controls. You may need to contact your organization's network or security administrator to review and adjust the policies.
2. **Verify IAM Permissions**:
    
    - Ensure that your user account has the necessary IAM roles to list container clusters. The required role is typically `roles/container.viewer` or a custom role with the `container.clusters.list` permission [[3]](https://serverfault.com/questions/1044638/sudden-permissions-denied-for-service-account).
3. **Switch to an Authorized Account**:
    
    - If you have access to another account with the necessary permissions, you can switch to that account using:
    
    ```bash
     gcloud auth login
    ```
    
4. **Consult Your Organization's Admin**:
    
    - If the issue persists, it may be best to consult with your organization's Google Cloud administrator to ensure that your account has the appropriate permissions and that the request complies with organizational policies.

# roles

To list all your roles in Google Cloud, you can use the `gcloud` command-line tool. Here are the steps:

1. **List all roles**:

```sh
   gcloud iam roles list
```

2. **List roles for a specific project**:

```sh
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] --flatten="bindings[].members" --format="table(bindings.role)"
```

3. **List roles for a specific service account**:

```sh
   gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT_ID] --flatten="bindings[].members" --format="table(bindings.role)" --filter="bindings.members:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]"
```

Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your project ID and `[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with your service account email [[IB from chatgpt]](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/iam/roles/list) [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47006062/how-do-i-list-the-roles-associated-with-a-gcp-service-account).

# VPC

**VPC Service Controls** in Google Cloud are designed to enhance the security of your data by creating security perimeters around your resources. These perimeters help mitigate data exfiltration risks by isolating resources of multi-tenant Google Cloud services [[IB from chatgpt]](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/) [[2]](https://developers.google.com/workspace/cloud-search/docs/guides/implement-vpc-service-controls).

### Key Features of VPC Service Controls:

- **Service Perimeters**: Define boundaries around your Google Cloud resources to control communication to and between those services.
- **Adaptive Access Control**: Enforce access controls based on IP ranges or device trust.
- **Ingress and Egress Rules**: Manage data flow into and out of your service perimeters.

### Policies:

- **Access Policies**: Define the rules and conditions under which access to resources is granted.
- **Service Perimeters**: Specify which resources are included within the perimeter and the conditions for accessing them.
- **Access Levels**: Create conditions based on IP addresses, device security status, etc.

### How to Check, Show, or List VPC Service Control Policies:

1. **List Access Policies**:

```sh
   gcloud access-context-manager policies list
```

2. **Describe a Specific Access Policy**:

```sh
   gcloud access-context-manager policies describe [POLICY_ID]
```

3. **List Service Perimeters**:

```sh
   gcloud access-context-manager perimeters list --policy [POLICY_ID]
```

4. **Describe a Specific Service Perimeter**:

```sh
   gcloud access-context-manager perimeters describe [PERIMETER_NAME] --policy [POLICY_ID]
```

Replace `[POLICY_ID]` with your access policy ID and `[PERIMETER_NAME]` with the name of your service perimeter [[IB from chatgpt]](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/) [[2]](https://developers.google.com/workspace/cloud-search/docs/guides/implement-vpc-service-controls) [[3]](https://scalesec.com/blog/vpc-service-controls-in-plain-english/).
