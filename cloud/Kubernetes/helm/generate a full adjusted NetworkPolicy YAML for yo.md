# generate a full adjusted NetworkPolicy YAML for your local testing.

Here is a full adjusted **NetworkPolicy** YAML manifest for your local Minikube testing environment, allowing egress traffic from your pods to your local Redis instance running outside the cluster (e.g., on your Mac), assuming your local machine IP is `192.168.1.100`. You should replace this IP with your actual local IP accessible from Minikube.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-redis-local-egress
  namespace: default   # Change namespace if your pods are in a different one
spec:
  podSelector: {}      # Selects all pods in the namespace
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 192.168.1.100/32   # Your local machine IP
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6378                # Redis port
```


### Explanation:

- `podSelector: {}` applies this policy to all pods in the namespace.
- `policyTypes: Egress` restricts outbound traffic.
- The rule allows egress TCP traffic on port 6378 only to your local machine IP.
- All other egress traffic is denied by default (because you specified egress rules).

---

### If you want to allow **all egress traffic** (simpler for local testing), use this instead:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all-egress
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
  egress:
    - {}  # Allow all egress traffic
```


---

### How to apply:

1. Save the YAML to a file, e.g., `netpol-local-redis.yaml`.
2. Apply it with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f netpol-local-redis.yaml
```


---

### Notes:

- Find your Mac’s IP reachable from Minikube by running `ifconfig` or `ipconfig getifaddr en0` on macOS.
- Minikube’s networking mode (Docker, Hyperkit, etc.) affects how pods reach your host machine. Sometimes `host.docker.internal` works as a DNS name instead of IP.
- Kubernetes NetworkPolicies require a compatible CNI plugin to enforce policies. Minikube’s default CNI usually supports basic NetworkPolicy enforcement.

---

This configuration adapts your production NetworkPolicy to your local testing environment where Redis runs outside the cluster, enabling your pods to communicate with it securely and effectively.
