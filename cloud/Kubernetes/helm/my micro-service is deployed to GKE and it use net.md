# my micro-service is deployed to GKE and it use networkpolicy engress to talks another redis service in GKE. the helm chart provide below. in my local minkube testing  env, it doesn't has enough resources to run istio. and the app only need to take reids running in local host env. how to adjust the configuration?

# Source: authsvc-cdb-int-crd-pr-helm/templates/netpol-redis.yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: redis-provisioning-ist-nane2
spec:
podSelector: {}
egress:
- ports:
- port: 6378
protocol: TCP
to:
- ipBlock:
cidr: 100.69.35.72/29
policyTypes:
- Egress

Given your scenario:

- Your micro-service in GKE uses a NetworkPolicy with egress rules to communicate with a Redis service inside the cluster.
- In your local Minikube environment, you don’t have enough resources to run Istio.
- Your app only needs to connect to a Redis instance running locally on your Mac (outside the cluster).

---

### How to adjust the NetworkPolicy configuration for Minikube local testing

Your current NetworkPolicy snippet allows egress only to a specific IP block inside the cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: redis-provisioning-ist-nane2
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  egress:
    - ports:
        - port: 6378
          protocol: TCP
      to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 100.69.35.72/29
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
```

This restricts egress traffic to Redis running at IPs in `100.69.35.72/29` on port 6378.

---

### In your local Minikube environment:

- Your Redis is running **outside the cluster**, on your local machine (e.g., localhost or host IP).
- The IP range `100.69.35.72/29` does **not** apply locally.
- Minikube pods will not be able to reach Redis unless you allow egress to the local machine IP or disable egress restrictions.

---

### Recommended adjustments:

#### Option 1: Allow egress to your local machine IP

- Find your Mac’s local network IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x` or `host.docker.internal` if using Docker driver).
- Modify the NetworkPolicy to allow egress to that IP on port 6378:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: redis-provisioning-ist-nane2
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  egress:
    - ports:
        - port: 6378
          protocol: TCP
      to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: <your-local-ip>/32
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
```

Replace `<your-local-ip>` with your Mac’s IP address accessible from Minikube.

---

#### Option 2: Allow all egress traffic (for local testing)

If you want to disable egress restrictions during local testing (simplest approach):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all-egress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  egress:
    - {}   # empty egress allows all outbound traffic
  policyTypes:
    - Egress
```

This allows your pods to connect to any IP and port, including your local Redis.

---

#### Option 3: Disable NetworkPolicy entirely in Minikube

If NetworkPolicy enforcement is not critical in local testing, you can skip applying the NetworkPolicy manifest altogether.

---

### Additional notes:

- Kubernetes NetworkPolicies are **enforced by the cluster CNI plugin**. Minikube’s default CNI may or may not enforce NetworkPolicies fully depending on the driver and version.
- Istio is **not required** for Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to work; they are native Kubernetes features.
- Since you don’t run Istio locally, you can simplify your testing by removing Istio-specific configurations and focusing on native Kubernetes NetworkPolicies or disabling them.

---

### Summary

| Scenario | Recommended Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Redis on local machine, Minikube | Adjust NetworkPolicy egress to allow local IP or allow all egress |
| Insufficient resources for Istio | Skip Istio installation; test with native Kubernetes NetworkPolicy or none |
| Local testing simplicity | Allow all egress or disable NetworkPolicy |


---

This approach aligns with Kubernetes NetworkPolicy best practices ([^1]) and adapts to your local Minikube environment constraints.
