# What are the key differences in resource management between helm install and upgrade

The key differences in resource management between `helm install` and `helm upgrade` revolve around how Kubernetes resources are created, updated, and managed during these operations:

## 1. Resource Creation vs. Update

- **`helm install`**
    - Creates all Kubernetes resources defined in the Helm chart from scratch as a new release.
    - It provisions deployments, services, config maps, secrets, and other resources fresh in the cluster under a unique release name.
    - If a release with the same name already exists, the install will fail to avoid conflicts.
    - This means all resources are new and managed as a single unit for that release.
    - Supports flags like `--atomic` to roll back if installation fails, ensuring no partial resource creation[^1][^2].
- **`helm upgrade`**
    - Updates an existing release by applying changes to the resources already deployed.
    - It compares the current state of resources with the new chart and values, then patches, adds, or deletes resources as needed to match the desired state.
    - Only the differences between the old and new manifests are applied, which can include scaling replicas, changing resource limits, updating images, or adding/removing resources.
    - Supports flags like `--cleanup-on-fail` to delete resources created during a failed upgrade and `--force` to recreate resources even if no changes detected[^1][^2].
    - Can reuse existing values or reset them, allowing fine-grained control over resource configuration during upgrades[^1].


## 2. Resource Versioning and Rollbacks

- Both commands create a **release record** that tracks the deployed chart version, configuration values, and resource states.
- `helm upgrade` preserves the release history and allows rolling back to previous versions if an upgrade causes issues, providing safer resource management and version control[^2][^5].


## 3. Handling of Configuration Changes

- During **install**, values from `values.yaml` or `--set` flags are applied to generate the initial resource manifests.
- During **upgrade**, changes in values or chart templates result in incremental updates to resource specifications such as replica counts, resource requests/limits, environment variables, etc. For example, changing replica count or memory limits is applied dynamically without recreating the entire release[^5].


## 4. Resource Deletion and Cleanup

- `helm upgrade` can remove resources that are no longer defined in the new chart version, effectively cleaning up obsolete resources.
- `helm install` does not delete anything since it installs fresh resources.


## 5. Efficiency and Automation

- `helm upgrade` is optimized for continuous deployment workflows, allowing automated, incremental updates to live applications with minimal disruption.
- `helm install` is typically used for initial deployment or fresh installs in new environments[^2][^5].

### Summary Table

| Aspect | helm install | helm upgrade |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Resource Creation | Creates all resources new | Updates existing resources |
| Resource Update | N/A | Applies incremental changes |
| Resource Deletion | N/A | Removes obsolete resources |
| Release History | Creates new release record | Updates release record, tracks versions |
| Rollback Support | Rollback on failure with `--atomic` | Full rollback support to prior versions |
| Configuration Application | Initial values applied | Merges new values with existing or resets |
| Use Case | Fresh deployment | Updating live applications |


---

### In essence:

- **`helm install`** provisions a new set of Kubernetes resources as a fresh release.
- **`helm upgrade`** manages ongoing resource changes efficiently by patching and reconciling only what’s needed, supporting rollbacks and cleanup.

This resource management distinction makes Helm a powerful tool for managing Kubernetes application lifecycles in both initial deployments and continuous updates[^1][^2][^5].
