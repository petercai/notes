# 50+ ChatGPT Prompts for Web Developers
If you're tired of tedious and repetitive coding tasks and want to optimize your efficiency, you're in the right place. With the power of ChatGPT, you can streamline your workflow, reduce errors, and even gain insights on improving your code.

In this blog post, we'll provide you with over 50 prompts and strategies that will help you speed up your web development workflow using ChatGPT. From learning concepts as a beginner to preparing for interviews, you'll find everything you need to make the most of AI as a web developer.

But first, it's important to understand ChatGPT's limitations. Although it's a powerful tool, ChatGPT can't substitute your own knowledge and skills. You should also fact-check any research it does for you, as ChatGPT can't verify facts. Furthermore, its training data is only up to 2021, so it may not be aware of current trends or events. With those caveats in mind, let's dive into the exciting world of AI-powered web development!

Code generation
---------------

ChatGPT can generate code for a variety of web development tasks, freeing up your time and helping you be more efficient. It can help you generate semantic HTML and CSS code, JavaScript functions, and even database queries.

**Prompt**: Generate a semantic and accessible HTML and (framework) CSS \[UI component\] consisting of \[component parts\]. The \[component parts\] should be \[layout\].

**Example**: Generate a semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS "Contact Support" form consisting of the user's name, email, issue type, and message. The form elements should be stacked vertically and placed inside a card.

**Prompt**: Write a JavaScript function. It accepts \[input\] and returns \[output\].

**Example**: Write a JavaScript function. It accepts a full name as input and returns avatar letters.

**Prompt**: Write a/ an \[framework\] API for \[functionality\]. It should make use of \[database\].

**Example**: Write an Express.js API to fetch the current user's profile information. It should make use of MongoDB.

**Prompt**: The database has \[comma-separated table names\]. Write a \[database\] query to fetch \[requirement\].

**Example**: The database has students and course tables. Write a PostgreSQL query to fetch a list of students who are enrolled in at least 3 courses.

Code completion
---------------

With the power of AI, ChatGPT can also suggest code completions that match your context and style.

**Prompt**: Complete the code \[code snippet\]

**Example**: Complete the code:

```typescript
const animals = ["dogs", "cats", "birds", "fish"];
let animal = animals[Math.floor(Math.random() * animals.length)];

switch (animal) {
  case "dogs":
    console.log(
      "Dogs are wonderful companions that bring joy and loyalty into our lives. Their wagging tails and wet noses never fail to make us smile."
    );
    break;
}

```

**Example**: Convert the below code snippet from JavaScript to TypeScript

```typescript
function nonRepeatingWords(str1, str2) {
  const map = new Map();
  const res = [];
  // Concatenate the strings
  const str = str1 + " " + str2;
  // Count the occurrence of each word
  str.split(" ").forEach((word) => {
    map.has(word) ? map.set(word, map.get(word) + 1) : map.set(word, 1);
  });
  // Select words which occur only once
  for (let [key, val] of map) {
    if (val === 1) {
      res.push(key);
    }
  }
  return res;
