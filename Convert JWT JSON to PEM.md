how to convert jwt json public key from web site to pem format

ChatGPTChatGPT

1 / 1

To convert a JSON Web Token (JWT) public key from a website to PEM format, you'll need to follow these general steps:

1.  **Extract the Public Key from the JWT JSON:** Typically, a JWT public key is provided in the form of a JSON object that includes the necessary details for the key, such as the modulus (`n`) and the exponent (`e`). Extract these values from the JSON.
    
2.  **Convert Modulus and Exponent to Base64:** The modulus and exponent are often provided as Base64-encoded strings in the JSON. Decode these Base64 strings to obtain the raw binary data.
    
3.  **Convert to RSA Public Key Format:** The modulus and exponent need to be combined to create the RSA public key. The typical format for an RSA public key in PEM format includes the `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` and `-----END PUBLIC KEY-----` delimiters.
    

Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide using OpenSSL command-line tools:

Assuming you have extracted the modulus and exponent from the JWT JSON and decoded them from Base64, you can use the following commands to convert them to a PEM format:

1.  **Convert Modulus and Exponent to Raw Binary:** Let's say `modulus.bin` contains the decoded modulus and `exponent.bin` contains the decoded exponent.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `base64 -d -i modulus.bin -o modulus_raw.bin
    base64 -d -i exponent.bin -o exponent_raw.bin` 
    
2.  **Combine Modulus and Exponent:** Combine the modulus and exponent into a single binary file.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `cat modulus_raw.bin exponent_raw.bin > rsa_pubkey.bin` 
    
3.  **Convert to PEM Format:** Now, you can convert the combined binary data into PEM format.
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `openssl rsa -inform der -in rsa_pubkey.bin -pubin -outform pem -out jwt_public_key.pem` 
    

The resulting `jwt_public_key.pem` file will contain the JWT public key in PEM format. You can then use this PEM file for various cryptographic operations.

Remember that the exact steps might vary depending on the structure of the JWT public key JSON and the tools available on your system. Always ensure you're working with secure and trusted sources when dealing with cryptographic keys.

public key jwt json format of spring reset service

ChatGPTChatGPT

1 / 1

Spring Security, a part of the Spring Framework, allows you to integrate security features, including JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, into your applications. When configuring JWT in a Spring Security application, you typically provide the public key in the form of a JSON Web Key (JWK) set. This set contains the public keys used to verify JWT signatures.

Here's an example of how the JWK JSON format might look in a Spring Security application:

jsonCopy code

`{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kid": "1",
      "kty": "RSA",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "n": "your_modulus_base64_encoded",
      "e": "AQAB"
    }
  ]
}` 

In this example:

*   `kid`: Key ID, a unique identifier for the key.
*   `kty`: Key Type, which indicates that it's an RSA key.
*   `alg`: Algorithm, specifying the algorithm used for signing (e.g., RS256 for RSA-SHA256).
*   `n`: Modulus, the Base64-encoded value of the RSA key's modulus.
*   `e`: Exponent, the exponent of the RSA key.

Replace `"your_modulus_base64_encoded"` and `"AQAB"` with the actual values of your RSA public key modulus and exponent, respectively.

Here's how you can use this JWK JSON in a Spring Security configuration:

javaCopy code

`@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2ResourceServer()
                .jwt()
                    .decoder(decoder());
    }

    JwtDecoder decoder() {
        return NimbusJwtDecoder.withJwkSetUri("URL_TO_JWK_SET_JSON").build();
    }
}` 

In the above configuration, replace `"URL_TO_JWK_SET_JSON"` with the actual URL pointing to your JWK set JSON.

The `NimbusJwtDecoder` is used to decode and verify JWT tokens using the provided JWK set. The Spring Security configuration allows you to customize the authentication and authorization rules according to your application's needs.

Remember that this is a simplified example, and the actual configuration might involve additional settings and considerations based on your application's requirements and security policies.

how to convert such response to pem format file

ChatGPTChatGPT

1 / 1

To convert the JSON Web Key (JWK) set response to a PEM format file, you'll need to extract the individual public key components (modulus and exponent) and then create an RSA public key in PEM format. Here's how you can do that:

Assuming you have the JWK set response as a JSON object like the one you mentioned earlier:

jsonCopy code

`{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kid": "1",
      "kty": "RSA",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "n": "your_modulus_base64_encoded",
      "e": "AQAB"
    }
  ]
}` 

Follow these steps:

1.  Extract the values of `"n"` (modulus) and `"e"` (exponent) from the JSON response.
2.  Decode the Base64-encoded modulus and convert it to a raw byte array.
3.  Decode the Base64-encoded exponent and convert it to a raw byte array.
4.  Combine the modulus and exponent to create an RSA public key.
5.  Convert the RSA public key to PEM format.

Here's a sample Python script that demonstrates this process using the `cryptography` library:

pythonCopy code

`from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import Encoding, PublicFormat
import base64
import json

jwk_response = """
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kid": "1",
      "kty": "RSA",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "n": "your_modulus_base64_encoded",
      "e": "AQAB"
    }
  ]
}
"""

jwk_data = json.loads(jwk_response)
modulus_base64 = jwk_data["keys"][0]["n"]
exponent_base64 = jwk_data["keys"][0]["e"]

modulus_bytes = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(modulus_base64 + "===")
exponent_bytes = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(exponent_base64 + "===")

public_numbers = rsa.RSAPublicNumbers(
    int.from_bytes(modulus_bytes, "big"),
    int.from_bytes(exponent_bytes, "big")
)

public_key = public_numbers.public_key(default_backend())

pem = public_key.public_bytes(
    encoding=Encoding.PEM,
    format=PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo
)

with open("jwt_public_key.pem", "wb") as pem_file:
    pem_file.write(pem)` 

Replace `"your_modulus_base64_encoded"` with the actual Base64-encoded modulus and `"AQAB"` with the actual Base64-encoded exponent from your JWK response. After running this script, you should have a `jwt_public_key.pem` file containing the RSA public key in PEM format.

improve the above to read public from url and convert it to pem file

ChatGPTChatGPT

1 / 1

Sure, here's an improved version of the Python script that reads the JWK set from a URL and converts the public key to a PEM file:

pythonCopy code

`import requests
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import Encoding, PublicFormat
import base64
import json

# Replace with the actual URL of the JWK set
jwk_url = "https://example.com/jwk-set-url"

response = requests.get(jwk_url)
jwk_data = response.json()

modulus_base64 = jwk_data["keys"][0]["n"]
exponent_base64 = jwk_data["keys"][0]["e"]

modulus_bytes = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(modulus_base64 + "===")
exponent_bytes = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(exponent_base64 + "===")

public_numbers = rsa.RSAPublicNumbers(
    int.from_bytes(modulus_bytes, "big"),
    int.from_bytes(exponent_bytes, "big")
)

public_key = public_numbers.public_key(default_backend())

pem = public_key.public_bytes(
    encoding=Encoding.PEM,
    format=PublicFormat.SubjectPublicKeyInfo
)

with open("jwt_public_key.pem", "wb") as pem_file:
    pem_file.write(pem)` 

Replace `"https://example.com/jwk-set-url"` with the actual URL of your JWK set. This script fetches the JWK set from the URL, extracts the modulus and exponent, and converts them to an RSA public key in PEM format just like before. The resulting `jwt_public_key.pem` file will contain the public key in PEM format.

Make sure to have the `cryptography` library installed by running:

bashCopy code

`pip install cryptography` 

Additionally, consider error handling and security measures when fetching data from URLs, as well as handling potential exceptions that might occur during network requests.
