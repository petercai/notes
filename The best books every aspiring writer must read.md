### You Are a Writer by Jeff Goins

> Writing is mostly a mind game. It’s about tricking yourself into becoming who you are. If you do this long enough, you begin to believe it. And pretty soon, you start acting like it. — Jeff Goins

Part memoir, part handbook, Goins delivers one of the most user-friendly reads for aspiring writers.

The book explains what it means to be a writer as the author worked to discover it for themself. One of the main messages is that prioritizing the skill and practice of writing is a must. In the beginning stages, nothing is more important than getting words on a page.

In You Are a Writer, the author also touches upon how to get your work in front of more people, from the basics of building an audience to leveraging that attention for greater writing opportunities.

### Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott

> Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere. ― Anne Lamott

Lamott is an expert writer with a streak of irreverence towards the standard rules of the craft. This makes for both an entertaining read as well as a hands-on guide to breaking rules well.

Much of Lamott’s advice revolves around the belief that the best writers are the ones who are most aware. They pay attention, ask questions, listen deeply, and capture the moments most people overlook.

This book is handy for writers who are unclear about the style or genre they would like to write because it champions experimentation above all else.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016/?ref=ghost.org)

### The Writing Life by Annie Dillard

> He is careful of what he reads, for that is what he will write. He is careful of what he learns, for that is what he will know. ― Annie Dillard

This short book is a treasure trove of inspirational content.

Although new writers will not find step-by-step instructions on the craft, Dillard does deliver a cohesive, enticing, and at times intimidating look at the process of creating great writing.

One of the overarching messages included in the book is a call not to hold back. At every opportunity, a writer should empty themselves and their ideas on to the page.

The fear that you will run out of ideas or stories is a normal part of the process but one that is easily remedied by following a schedule for input ([reading](https://www.ramoswriter.com/how-to-read-more/?ref=ghost.org)) and output (writing).

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Life-Annie-Dillard/dp/0060919884/?ref=ghost.org)

### Zen in the Art of Writing by Ray Bradbury

> Write. Don't think. Relax. ― Ray Bradbury

As one of the most prolific writers of the last century, Bradbury is a voice every writer should read at least once.

Their guide for writers encourages creatives to get lost in their work, not let logic suffocate creativity, and allow ideas to carry them to unexpected places (instead of always trying to control the process).

The author's advice focuses on fiction storytelling but also includes sections on nonfiction and poetry. Regardless of your chosen genre, this resource will help free your creative process.

### On Writing by Stephen King

> Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work. ― Stephen King

There’s a reason almost every writing resource list mentions this book by Stephen King: it’s that good.

On Writing is an intensely practical book, told through the lens of King’s life stories, and filled with concrete examples of how to transform forgettable sentences into remembered treasures.

Plus, the author has a knack for spinning their insights into motivational pieces so that readers not only come away from the book understanding how to write better, but wanting to commit to the practice as well.

[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King/dp/1982159375/?ref=ghost.org)

### Writing Down the Bones by Natalie Goldberg

> Writing is the act of discovery. ― Natalie Goldberg

Although writing may be an applied skill, there are also emotional and psychological aspects to it.

Goldberg captures these deeper elements of writing in their book in order to help writers communicate more fully through their words. For the author, great writing is a product of facing difficult subjects head-on and then inviting others onto the journey with you.

One technique mentioned in the book which many new writers find helpful is to write with a pen and paper instead of a computer and keyboard. This tactile element can help connect the writer to their subject while preventing blocks sometimes caused by a blinking cursor.

### The Sense of Style by Steven Pinker

> Style still matters, for at least three reasons. First, it ensures that writers will get their message across… Second, style earns trust. \[Third\] it adds beauty to the world. — Steven Pinker

Pinker is a Harvard professor of psychology who writes on how language and the brain connect. One would expect a style guide from such a writer to be dry or academic.

Instead, Pinker delivers a love letter to the craft that explores not only what makes good writing, but why our brains recognize it as such.

Throughout the book, one of the most valuable practices is how the author reverse-engineers what great writers do in specific passages so that new writers can attempt the same moves in their work.

It’s recommended to pick up a physical copy of this book, since having it within reach will be exceptionally useful during your editing phases.

### On Writing Well by William Zinsser

> Writing is thinking on paper. ― William Zinsser

This book is the gold standard for writing great nonfiction.

Nonfiction isn't only about real stories but also ideas, arguments, and data. These elements are just as essential as plot or character are to fiction, and learning how to master them is crucial.

The third section in Zinsser’s book covers particular forms of nonfiction writing, such as interviews and memoirs. This is a great place to start for those looking for a subgenre that aligns with their skills and interests.

> Hard work is only a prison sentence when you lack motivation. ― Malcolm Gladwell

Gladwell is one of the most prominent writers alive today because they do two difficult things well: challenge assumptions and transition smoothly.

Most of Gladwell’s books address topics people think they know well. But, if you can surprise your readers in some way, you can be sure they will tell others about what they’ve read.

Moving from one idea to another, whether across a paragraph or a page, can be tricky. Gladwell does this with supreme ease, often forgoing "proper" transition phrases altogether. If you'd like to learn how to smooth out your writing, give this title a read.

Many of the books mentioned in this list explain why brevity and conciseness are important to great writing. Holiday embodies these elements.

Their books are typically shorter than most nonfiction books, but the remarkable part is how much information Holiday is able to convey in a single sentence. They can tell stories in a few lines that would take other writers several pages.

For those wanting to trim the fat in their writing, this is one author worth studying.

### Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon

> The best advice is not to write what you know, it’s to write what you like. ― Austin Kleon

The most prolific creators, writers or otherwise, understand how to _steal_ well.

For Kleon, this practice isn't simply taking what others have done and presenting it as your own. Instead, it's understanding how to follow the same processes, chase the same goals, and evoke the same emotions as the original does.

This is an excellent resource for those who want to create like their heroes without copying them.

Creators will never be completely free from distractions, roadblocks, and fears.

The solution, then, is to push through it. Your best ideas are already there; they just need you to fight for them.

How do you make something that lasts beyond your lifetime? This is the question Holiday answers with their book by examining common elements from the classics still read today.

Beneath the discussion of enduring work is the theme of funding that work. Despite the rare cases of broke artists becoming famous after their deaths, most of the classic works we still interact with today were popular when they were current.

The more financially successful a project is, the more likely it is to survive. Success isn’t an enemy of creative work — it’s the fuel for it.
