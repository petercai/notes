How do we interact with Linux Filesystem via file descriptors?

A file descriptor represents an open file. It is a unique number assigned by the operating system to each file. It is an **abstraction** for working with files. We need to use file descriptors to read from or write to files in our program. Each process maintains its own file descriptor table.

The diagram below shows the layered architecture in Linux filesystem. Let‚Äôs take process 1234 as an example.

üîπ In User Space  
When we open a file called ‚ÄúfileA.txt‚Äù in Process 1234, we get file descriptor fd1, which is equal to 3. We can then pass the file descriptor to other functions to write data to the file.

üîπ In Kernel Space  
In Linux kernel, there is a **process table** to maintain the data for the processes. Each process has an entry in the table. Each process maintains a file descriptor table, with file descriptors as its indices. Notice that file descriptors 0,1 and 2 are reserved in each file descriptor table to represent stdin, stdout, and stderr.

The file pointer points to an entry in the **open file table**, which has information about open files across all processes. Multiple file descriptors can point to the same file table entry. For example, file descriptor 0, 1 and 2 points to the same open file table entry.¬†

Since different open file table entries can represent the same file, it is a waste of resources to store the file static information so many times. We need another abstraction layer called ‚Äòvnode table‚Äô to store the static data.

In each file table entry, there is a vnode pointer, which points to an entry in **vnode table**. The static information includes file type, function pointers, reference counts, inode etc. inode describes a physical object in the filesystem.

üîπ In Filesystem  
The inode array element stores the actual file information, including permission mode, owners, timestamps, etc. inode also points to the data blocks stored in the filesystem.

Over to you: When we close a file in a program, do you know which entries are deleted in these data structures?

Do you know how you get paid at work?¬†In the US, tech companies usually run payrolls via Automatic Clearing House (**ACH**).

ACH handles retail transactions and is part of American retail payment systems. It processes transactions in **batches**, not in real-time. The diagram below shows how ACH direct deposit works with payrolls.

üîπStep 0: Before we can use ACH network, the originator who starts the transactions needs to open an account at a commercial bank because only banks are allowed to initiate ACH transactions directly. The bank is called ODFI (Originating Depository Financial Institution). Then the transaction receiver needs to authorize the originator for certain types of transactions.¬†¬†¬†

üîπStep 1: The originator company originates salary payment transactions. The transactions are sent to a 3rd-party processor like Gusto. The third-party processor helps with ACH-related services like generating ACH files, etc.

üîπStep 2: The third-party processor generates ACH files on behalf of the originator. The files are uploaded to an SFTP established by the ODFI. This should be done by the 7 PM cut-off time, as specified by the ODFI bank.

üîπStep 3: After normal business hours in the evening, the ODFI bank forwards the ACH files to the ACH operator for clearing and settlement. There are two ACH operators, one is the Federal Reserve (FedACH), and the other is EPN (Electronic Payment Network ‚Äì which is operated by a private company).

üîπStep 4: The ACH files are processed around midnight and made available to the receiving bank RDFI (Receiving Depository Financial Institution.)

üîπStep 5: The RDFI operates on the receiver‚Äôs bank accounts based on the instructions in the ACH files. In our case, the receiver receives $100 from the originator. This is done when the RDFI opens for business at 6 AM the next day.

ACH is a next-day settlement system. It means transactions sent out by 7 PM on one day will arrive the following morning.

Since 2018, it‚Äôs possible to choose Same Day ACH so funds can be transferred on the same business day.

Over to you: ACH is a US financial network. If you live outside the US, do you know what payment method your employer uses to send payment? What‚Äôs the difference between ACH and wire transfer?
